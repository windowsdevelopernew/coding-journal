                       <p>As many other Windows Phone / Windows 8 / Universal apps developers (lets just call us WinRT developers) I watched the Build 2015 keynote last night. And I did not like it. I know Microsoft does not know to communicate but the message for me was clear. We, the WinRT developer, are no longer needed.</p>

<p>First, Microsoft announced that WPF apps will be allowed to be submitted to the Windows Store to be used on desktops / tablets. So why would anyone want to develop (or want to have developed) a Windows 8 (WinRT) app, when they can just use WPF and get everything done easier? I do not know.</p>

<p>But allowing WPF apps to the Windows Store is a small news compared to the ability to run Android apps on Windows Phone. The first news talked about porting Android apps to the Windows Phone, but later, [statements like this][1] appeared</p>

<p><em>Android developers will be able to submit versions of their apps, written in Java or C++, to the Windows Store in he form of APKs and have those apps work on Windows Phone 10 devices. Android developers should be able to start submitting apps to the Windows 10 Store some time in the next few months.</em></p>

                       <p>In my recent universal (Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1) project I implemented PlayReady DRM protected smooth streaming movies playback using the [Player Framework][1]. This projects seems to be dead, but it is still the best option when implementing any kind of video playback.</p>

<p>One of the first things I had to do was localize it&#8217;s controls, because the app I worked on was in Czech and Slovak, not in English (the only language the Player Framework supports out of the box). Not all the texts an be localized, but the most visible ones like button labels and error messages can.</p>

<p>To create your own localization, I suggest you create a new RESW file in your project. You can use and existing one, but I prefer to separate the texts for the Player Framework from texts for the rest of the app.</p>

                       <p>In my previous article I showed you [how to implements server side caching using ETag][1]. HTTP clients on other platforms can usually work with ETag automatically, but of course, the portable HTTP client used on Windows platforms cannot. You have to implement ETag handling yourself.</p>

<p>In [TvTime][2], all the server requests are GET request, so I remember the ETag values for each Url (= each GET request). I store the ETag values in application local settings.</p>

<p>When the app wants to get some data, I perform a GET request including the ETag as the If-None-Match header. If my ETag matches with the ETag on the server, the server returns HTTP 304 Not Modified and I return the cached data from disk. Otherwise I read the response body and return it.</p>

                       <p>Caching data is usually a good idea, especially when creating APIs for mobile clients and the user may pay for each transferred byte. There are many approaches to caching data (I recommend reading [this article][1]), in my last NancyFX project I used ETag.</p>

<p><strong>ETag</strong></p>

<p>ETag is a HTTP header that acts as a hash of the data. When the server returns a response, it computes a hash of the data and sends it to the client. When the client requests the data again, it includes the ETag in its request. The server compares the ETag with the hash of the current data and if they match (the data did not change), it returns an empty responses with a HTTP 304 status code.</p>

                       <p>The Raspberry Pi is a small embedded computing device that you can use for [many different software and hardware projects][1]. One of the first projects I did with the Pi was turning it into a device that would measure, record and display the room temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Hadrware</strong></p>

<p>To make the project, you will of course need a Raspberry Pi. I use my old Raspberry Pi model B, any newer one would also work. You also need a DS18B20 temperature sensor and a RRU 4K7 resistor. You can buy the separately, or you can buy the [Raspberry Pi YouTube Workshop Kit][2] that also contains both parts.</p>

<p>To connect the temperature sensor to the Pi, I suggest you follow the [YouTube tutorial for the kit][3]. You can also solder the temperature sensor and the resistor into one piece and connect it to the Pi using [this schema][4], so the result then looks like this</p>

                       <p>I am not a mouse or a touch person, I like using the keyboard and keyboard shortcuts for everything. So when I (have to) use a Windows 8.1 Metro app, I always miss when the app does not navigate back when I press the Backspace key, just like the browser does.</p>

<p>Implementing this functionality is really simple, you just need to handle the KeyUp event and listen for the Backspace key. You can implement the KeyUp event handler on every View in your app, but that is not necessary. You can just hook up the global Window.Current.CoreWindow.KeyUp event after you app starts.</p>

                       <p>I have been owning and using a Raspberry Pi for over a year now. I started with Raspberry Pi model B and now I added Raspberry Pi 2 immediately after it was announced. Thanks to the fact that an IoT version of Windows 10 will run on the Pi, there is quite a hype about the Pi 2. Many people who did not care about the Pi before are now buying it because of that hype. And mostly they do not know what to do with it. So here is a list of things I used the Pi for, maybe you can get inspired.</p>

<p><strong>Media center</strong></p>

<p>I always wanted a small cheap low power media center to watch downloaded TV shows on the TV. The Pi was an ideal machine to built. I connected the Pi to a power source, ethernet, external hard drive the TV using HDMI. My distro of choice was [RaspBMC][1] at first but then I switched to [XBIAN][2]. Using this setup, the PI run XBMC (a media center software), that scanned the connected hard drive, found all the downloaded TV shows, and downloaded their metadata to make the experience better. Thanks to HDMI throughput I was able to control XBMC on the PI using the TV remote, not keyboard or mouse needed.</p>

                       <p>I use two computers, my desktop computer located at home and set up for work and play and a work notebook (company provided) that I usually leave at the office. I use both computers for work and sometimes I forget to do &#8216;git push&#8217; when working at my home desktop computer. The next day, when using the work notebook, I wonder where the code from the previous day has disappeared.</p>

<p>Of course, I can solve it by connecting to my home Raspberry Pi through SSH, waking the desktop computer over LAN from it, connecting to it using Remote Desktop to do the &#8216;git push&#8217; .. not really a simple solution, there must be a better way.</p>

                       <p>NancyFX is a great .NET framework well suited for creating REST APIs. There are many ways how to approach authentication, the simplest one is the good old Forms Authentication. The idea of Forms Authentication is that the user logs in with a username and password and gets a cookie, the protected endpoints then check the cookie. NancyFX supports Forms Authentication with the [Nancy.Authentication.Forms][1] package. The [documentation describes how to use it on a web page][2], but to use it with a REST API a few changes are needed.</p>

<p><strong>Forms Authentication differences for REST API</strong></p>

<p>There are things you want to do differently in a REST API than on a web page. If a user tries to access a protected endpoint, the Forms Authentication on a normal web page redirects him to the login page. In REST API, you typically want the endpoint just to return HTTP 401, no redirects. Also, when a user successfully logs in, you just typically want to return HTTP 200, no redirects.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone 8.1 XAML contains a Pivot control that looks like the one from Windows Phone <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> and also should behave the same way, but does not. You will find the first problem with the new Pivot when you want to change the PivotItem header color.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Phone <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></strong></p>

<p>If you want to change the PivotItem header color in Windows Phone <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>, you just define the color in the Header template:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/a49d0c7d471c4de42521.js?file=wp8.xaml"></script>

<p>This works great, changing the color of the active PivotItem Header to the color you want and applying some opacity to the inactive PivotItem Headers.</p>
