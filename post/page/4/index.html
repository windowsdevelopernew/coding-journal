                       <p>I have been developing Windows Phone apps for a few years now, always sticking to Silverlight and keeping using Silverlight also after Microsoft announced the WinRT flavor of Windows Phone apps and the so called Universal Apps. The Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 Silverlight APIs have some limitations, but are now well known do not contain many bugs. They are the safe choice if you want to create a Windows Phone apps. And do not forget that there are still many device running Windows Phone 8 (like Verizon customers in the US) that never got the 8.1 updated promised to everyone during the summer.</p>

<p><strong>Really universal?</strong></p>

<p>Windows Phone 8.1 XAML and Universal Apps included WinRT APIs that have many problems, including some that there is no solution for. I used the WinRT APIs when creating first Windows 8 apps about 2 years ago, so I am not new to the APIs. I have not touched the WinRT APIs again until recently, because there was no demand for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 apps. Why would it? People use Windows 8 or 8.1 but do not care about Metro apps, they give them no value compared to &#8220;normal&#8221; Win32 and Windows tablets are practically non-exists (expect for the Surface tablets owned by few programmers and maybe no one else).</p>

                       <p>Communicating with a JSON based REST service is a task that many Windows Phone apps have to do. My apps sure do it a lot so I came up with a base class that I use in all of them, [put it on Github][1] and [created a Nuget package][2], so your apps could use it to.</p>

<p>The usage of this base class is simple. Create your service class and inherit from BaseRestService. The minimum you need to do to make it work is to override the GetBaseUrl() method to set the base url for all the requests. You can (but do not have to) also override the GetRequestHeaders() method to set the default request headers.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/405732bf92858dba1c3c.js?file=usage1.cs"></script>

<p>and you can now use the following protected methods</p>

                       <p>I have been building Windows Phone apps using the [Caliburn.Micro][1] framework for some time now. Setting up a new project takes some time and can be easily automated, so I decided to create a Visual Studio template for Windows Phone apps build with Caliburn.Micro.</p>

<p>The templates can be downloaded from [the Visual Studio Extensions gallery][2] and used to build Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps. It contains the basic setup with Caliburn Micro and [Fody][3], with a sample view and viewmodel.</p>

<p>The [source code is available on GitHub][4], so if you want to modify it to best suit your needs, feel free to do it.</p>

                       <p>I recently worked on an ASP.NET application that needed to detect if users were coming from tablets or smartphones. The project used data from <a href="http://user-agent-string.info/">http://user-agent-string.info/</a> to do this detection, but the result were not really good. We needed a better solution, so I came up with using [WURFL][1].</p>

<p>WURFL, the Wireless Universal Resource FiLe, is a Device Description Repository (DDR), i.e. a software component that maps HTTP Request headers to the profile of the HTTP client (Desktop, Mobile Device, Tablet, etc.) that issued the request. Adding WURFL to your ASP.NET application is easy thanks to the [WURFL_Official_API Nuget package][2]. The Nuget package also contains definition file, so you just need to update the Nuget package once in a while to get your definition file up to date.</p>

                       <p>The about screen of a Windows Phone app is usually the most overlooked part of the app. Sure, the users usually visit it only once, after installing the app, if ever, but it is a part of your Windows Phone app that you could put to a good use.</p>

<p>If you have ever taken a DVLUP challenge you may have noticed, that they recommend you place a text describing your app on the about screen. I really do not agree with this. If users install your app, they know what the app does and if they cannot figure it out, then your UI is a failure and the about screen will not save you.</p>

<p>After some trial and error I came up with a standardized about screen I now use in all my apps. It is a pivot with two tabs; About and More apps.</p>

<img src="/images/sk.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>In this promotion, your app has to cost less than half of the normal price. The app normally costs 1.29 USD in most countries and 0.99 USD in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia to boost the sales. The minimum price in Windows Phone Store is 0.99 USD so the app had to be made free for the promotion. So I filled in the form saying that I want my app to be free in all the countries during the promotion. When the time of the promotion came, the price was set to free in all the countries except Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia. First day, first problem.</p>

                       <p>My MVVM framework of choice, Caliburn.Micro, provides a simple Dependency Injection container, where you have to register all your ViewModels and Services. This is done in the Bootstraper&#8217;s Configure method and may look like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=reg1.cs"></script>

<p>where you typically register your ViewModels as per request and services as singletons.</p>

<p>Of course this is done just once, but having to register a ViewModel each time you create a new one can be a nuisance, especially in a large project.</p>

                       <p>In my current project I needed to solve one quite interesting problem. Imagine you have a map with some pins representing points of interest. If the user taps on a pin, a label with the place title is shown like on this image (that is not from the real project, obviously).</p>

<img src="/images/image_thumb_4_4.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>The client had an interesting requirement. When the user taps the pin and the label is shown, they wanted the label to be centered on the map (basically move the map so the label appears in the middle of the map).</p>

                       <p>Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again). Ignoring certificate errors would be a much more comfortable approach. Of course, only do it in development with dev servers, not in production.</p>

<p>In Windows Phone 8.1 there are strangely two HttpClient classes, one in System.Net.Http and another in Windows.Web.Http. Normally you would go with the one in System.Net.Http because you are probably using it thanks to the mentioned Portable HTTP Client Libraries on every other platform. You are out of luck in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, if you want to ignore certificate errors, you have to use the one from Windows.Web.Http, because only this one accepts an IHttpFilter as an argument.</p>
