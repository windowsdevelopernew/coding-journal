                       <p>As you may have noticed, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/?utm_content=buffer882bd&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">static site generation is the next big think</a>. When I created this blog a few years ago I choose Wordpress, because it seemed like a good choice. Now I have grown tired with updating plugins, exchanging broken plugins for alternative ones and so one. So I decided to try to go the static site generation route to make the blog easier to maintain.</p>

<p><strong>Jekyll? Octopress? FsBlog? Hugo!</strong></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">quite a few static site generators</a> out there, so choosing the right one is quite a challenge. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> seemed like the obvious choice. Jekyll requires Ruby, which is ok even on Windows, but Octopress had a few dependencies that I did not manage to get working on Windows. <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FsBlog">FsBlog</a> seemed interesting, especially for me being a F# enthusiast, but frankly it is not yet very usable. So I choose Hugo.</p>

                       <p>I have a built-in fingerprint reader on my Thinkpad notebook that I use for loging in almost exclusively. I say almost because since I upgraded to Windows 10 it sometimes just stops working when the computer wakes up from sleep. I found out that to make it work again I have to go to the Device Manager, find it, disable it and enabled it back again.</p>

<p>Of course, I was looking for a way to automate this, because I do not think that this issue will be fixed any time soon by Microsoft or Lenovo. I found out there is a <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Device-Management-7fad2388">PowerShell cmdlet that expose device enumeration and management APIs</a>. Using this cmdlet I wrote a simple PowerShell script to the the work.</p>

                       <p>I have a Lenovo Thinpad T440s that I got about a year ago after a great experience with a company issued Lenovo Thinkpad T420 I used for about two and half years before that. I use it daily for on-site work, not so much at home, where I have a desktop computer. The T440s is thinner and lighter than T420, but otherwise everything is just worse. You cannot change RAM or disk so easily as on the T420, the keyboard and trackpoint are worse (the trackpoint does not have physical buttons like on the T420 but [I had it replaced for one that does][1]).</p>

<p>So why did I get the T440s? Because it seemed like a wise choice at the time, compared to the competition. It has a trackpoint, fingerprint reader, a keyboard with all the keys in the right place and it is, after all, a Thinkpad, a sturdy and reliable work machine build from good materials.</p>

<p>But not really. As every Thinkpad fan can tell you, the quality of Thinkpads is declining (even when not counting the plastic Thinkpad Edge computers that are not &#8220;real&#8221; Thinkpads). It seems like Lenovo simply does not care, making the hardware worse and software even more so. Gone are the superb ThinkVantage tools, only the Thinkpad update utility remained. And it often install software and drivers that can screw up your computer. It happened to many times, this is the latest incident.</p>

                       <p>In my current project I had to implement an interesting feature for both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 project of the Universal app. The idea is simply. The users want to search for a movie. They enter a search term into a TextBox and a list of results is shown. The results should have the search term highlighted in them.</p>

                       <p>Last week I came upon a really bizarre problem that you may also find interesting. Lets start with a bit of context.</p>

<p><strong>Tl;Dr</strong>: There seems to be a bug in Windows phone 8.1 that can make your app and the phone freezes when displaying images over HTTPS from some servers. Skip to <a href="#bug">the end of this article</a> to see a video and get the source code.</p>

<p><strong>The Windows Phone app</strong></p>

<p>The app is a Windows Phone 8 shopping app for the biggest Czech online retailer. The main screen of the app contains quite a bit of data, usually about ten carousel with about 10 products and the list of main categories, so about 10 more images.</p>

<p>In worst case the main screen contains over 10 hundred images. It was quite a hassle to make it work well in the Windows Phone 8 SDK (no, rewriting a shopping about with about 70 screens to Windows Phone 8.1 is not feasible). But it work juts fine. Until last week.</p>

                       <p>I do not make much money on my Windows Phone apps (who does?), but when the payout time comes every couple of months, I expect the money to be delivered. Dealing with Microsoft, I should know better.</p>

<p><strong>Failed payment</strong></p>

<p>Last month I looked into the Dev Center and saw that my scheduled payment failed, telling me to contact the support. So I did. The result was one moth of exchanging email without a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with support</strong></p>

<p>The Microsoft employee told me that I am in a small group of people with this problem. I do not know if I have such a bad look always be in a problematic supposedly small group, or that the group are not that small. He told me that Microsoft will retry the payment. The payment was supposedly retried on June 24th and succeeded. So they say.</p>

<p><em>Great news, your June payout was returned due to an internal issue; however, the payout of 5264.17 CZK has been re-attempted and was successfully completed on June 24th. If you have not received the payout then please review this transaction with your bank. Please let me know if you have any further questions.</em></p>

<p>I never got the money. The employee asked me a few times if I got the money and then resigned, telling me that it is my problem and I should check with my bank. Of course I checked with my bank, they do not have the money. If they had, they would transfer it to my account.</p>

                       <p>By default, Visual Studio shows the name of the opened solution name in the title. This makes it easier to navigate among multiple instances of Visual Studio. You see the solution name next to the Visual Studio icon in the taskbar and also in the task manager, when you have to (and we all sometimes have to) kill the right Visual Studio because it stopped responding.</p>

<p>I work with Git, switching branches frequently, especially working on features and bug fixes. In this situation, it would be nice if Visual Studio showed not only the solution name but also the current branch in its title. No problem, there is an extension for that.</p>

<p>The extension is called [Rename Visual Studio Window][1] and it works with Visual Studio 2015, 2013, 2012, 2010. This extension supports Git, so you can easily add the branch name to the title with a config like mine using [gitBranchName].</p>

                       <p>In a recent project I had to implement Google login to an Universal App. I decided to use the native [WebAuthenticationBroker][1] control and the implementation was not as straightforward as I hoped. By implementing Google login I mean getting the authentication token that you can then use with your server API.</p>

<p>WebAuthenticationBroker is a good idea but it is implemented rather poorly. It works differently on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 due to the &#8220;AndContinue&#8221; pattern that Windows Phone 8.1 forces on you. You can solve this with [some ifdefs and platform specific code, as always][2].</p>

<p>The real problem s that the [MSDN sample][3] states it works with Google login but it does not. The sample thinks it gets the authentication token but it does not, it just gets the success code that you have to exchange for the authentication token yourself.</p>
