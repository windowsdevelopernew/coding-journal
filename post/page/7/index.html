                       Windows 8 development has many problems and pitfalls because of WinRT. Windows Store, the only distribution channel for Windows 8 apps, has some problems too. One of them is really serious for everyone who wants to create a newspaper or newsreader app with in-app purchases. We developed a Windows 8 app for a local newspaper. The content consists of issues, there is one issue published each work day. The users can buy the issues using in-app purchases.

                       I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget. Windows Phone Code: https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP7 Nuget: https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP7/ Windows 8 Code: https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WinRT Nuget: https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WinRT My Windows 8 mini-library is best used with the WinRTXAMLToolkit that I contributed to once ot twice.

                       Let&#8217;s face it, there are no really great apps for Windows 8 and the number of trashy apps is also very low compared to the Android and iOS ecosystems. Microsoft looks really desperate to bring more apps and developers to the ecosystem. Instead of improving the API and its capabilities, Microsoft just generates desperately looking campaigns to improve the apps count. I sometimes wonder if they ever realize that the number of apps is not important when people cannot find the apps they are used to use on Android or iOS in the Windows Store.

                       Passing the certification in Windows Phone Store and Windows Store can be a very painful process, but after a few tries you get enough experience to pass your apps on the first try. You may sometimes get a tester who is really dumb and fails your app for a made up reason but usually it is just enough to submit it again so another testers gets to test it. Lately I have been seeing a strange shift in the testing quality done in the certification process.

                       Windows Azure finally has a good F# support. Creating F# Worker Roles is supported right from the wizzard in Visual Studio and you can create a F# Web Role using the F# C# MVC template. I decided to try it out and the first thing I needed to implement was logging. I decided for logging to Azure Table Storage. I assume you have a basic idea of how Azure Table Storage works.

                       I needed to create an utility that would read Excel 2010 files (.xlsx) and generate XML files from them according to some specific rules. The catch was that the utility needed to run on MacOS instead of Windows. Reading and writing Excel files from .NET is very easy using the Microsoft.Office.Interop assemblies but they use Excel through COM and that makes them unusable outside of Windows. I found some 3rd party libraries for working with Excel and analzyed them with The Mono Migration Analzyer (MoMA).

                       Uploading a file in ASP.NET MVC is very easy, but there is no easy way to detect the encoding of a uploaded text file. However you can use the fact if you try to read the file with a wrong encoding, you get an DecoderFallbackException. So how do you put everything together? First, get a stream of the uploaded file. Next, read the whole file to a byte array Finally

                       While reading an article that had nothing in common with programming I came upon a sudden need to find a way to generate all the permutations of a list, or more exactly a string (it is just a list of characters). As lazy as I am I tried to google a few examples of C# code that does exactly that. I was horrified that programmers could come up with the complicated ways I found.

                       Windows Phone allows yout to use custom TTF fonts in your apps. Using a custom font from XAML or C# is easy, but your run into troubles when you want to use if from a Background Agent (e.g: for updating a Live Tile). Adding font to solution The custom font must be a TTF, you can also use a ZIP file with multiple TTF files. You need to know the name of the font to identify it.

                       Sublime Text 2 is a great multi-purpose text editor that you can run on Windows, MacOS and Linux. You can configure Sublime Text 2 to higlight and compile F# files and even to use F# Interactive and make it a F# REPL. Using Sublime Text 2 as F# REPL is useful when you work on MacOS and Linux (F# 3.0 works great with Mono) and cannot use Visual Studio 2012. If you are new to Sublime Text 2, check out the Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text: Free Course.
