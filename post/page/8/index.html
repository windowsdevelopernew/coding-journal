                       If you want to host your .NET project on the Internet, there are classic ASP.NET webhosting on one side of the spectrum and Microsoft Azure on the other. If you are looking for something in the middle, take a look at AppHarbor. AppHarbor AppHarbor is a flexible and scalable .NET Platform-as-a-Service, that you can even use for free, limited to one web or worker role. It runs in AWS and is quite similiar to Heroku.

                       Gamification is a great concept that works really well for some people, including me. Gamification may very well be the reason for success of projects like StackOveflow or Duolingo. Visual Studio Achievements Visual Studio Achievements is Visual Studio plugin that rewards you for good practices like having 1000 localized values (Localization Master) and even for bad practices like writin a single line of 300 characters long (Scroll Bar Wizard). For some of the achievements you need to have FxCop installed, but the majority get awareded without the need for it.

                       I have been playing with MonoTouch only for a few days when I already started to miss all the .NET libraries I commonly use. The first one I needed to get working with MonoTouch was JSON.NET. MonoDevelop does not support Nuget so you have to get your libaries the old way. I downloaded JSON.NET package from Nuget.org, but it does not contain a DLL built for Mono. Harldy any Nuget package does.

                       Beeing quite disappointed with the Windows Phone platform recently I started to look for other ways to use my .NET skills and to develop for a mobile platform at the same time. I found MonoTouch, a product from Xamarin that allows you to build iOS apps using C# with Mono. What is MonoTouch? MonoTouch is a product or a framework do develop iOS apps using Mono (an open-source .NET implementation). It allows you to use C# (hopefuly also F# although I have not been able to get it to work yet) and all the .NET features libraries you use and like and of course your existing codebase.

                       Before I start with the actual arguments I feel a need to state my background first so you do not mistake me with just another hater rattling about things he does not know. I have been a long time .NET developer, I have worked with winforms, webforms, mvc, compact framework. I really like C# and love F#. In February I started to work as a full time Windows Phone developer. Although I have been programming exclusively for Windows 8 for the last few months I have a ton of experience with Windows Phone programming.

                       When navigating in a Windows Store app, you can specify a navigation parameter. This navigation parameter can be any object but there is a problem. When the application is suspended, this navigation parameter is saved by the LayoutAwarePage. This works only with primitive data types, unless you change the implementation of the class which instances you pass as the navigation parameter. I use mainly ints (article id, gallery id &#8230;) as navigation parameters but sometimes just on int is not enough.

                       There is no AutoCompleteBox control that can be used when building Windows Store apps in C# and XAML so I decided to create one, because I needed it for a project. Currently it supports only String collections and the selected value must be accessed using code behind, but this will hopefully change. The AutoCompleteBox uses WinRT XAML Toolkit to show the watermark and Reactive Extensions so the users does not need to press enter, the results will show after they stop typing for a second.

One of the best features that comes with F# 3.0 shipped with Visual Studio 2012 is Type Providers. What are Type Providers? According to MSDN documentation, an F# type provider is a component that provides types, properties, and methods for use in your program.

                       I use my Nokia Lumia 800 also as a music player, with a few annoyances but nothing I could not live with. When I tried to use the HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8 as a music player, the situation was quite different. The first thing that annoys me is more of a HTC&#8217;s fault than Windows Phone&#8217;s. The HTC 8X has Beats Audio. It does not really say what it is or does, it just says it is there.

                       If you use Windows Phone 7, your region for the Windows Phone Store is determined by the region of your Live ID you use with the phone. The region of your Live ID cannot be changed, so if you move to another country or just want to access apps that are not available in your country there is nothing you can to about it. Changing region in your phone does not help.
