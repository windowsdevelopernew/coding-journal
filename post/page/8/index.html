                        <p>If you want to host your .NET project on the Internet, there are classic ASP.NET webhosting on one side of the spectrum and Microsoft Azure on the other. If you are looking for something in the middle, take a look at <a href="https://appharbor.com/">AppHarbor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>AppHarbor</strong></p>

<p>AppHarbor is a flexible and scalable .NET Platform-as-a-Service, that you can even <a href="https://appharbor.com/pricing">use for free</a>, limited to one web or worker role. It runs in AWS and is quite similiar to Heroku.</p>

<p><strong>Variety of Add-ons</strong></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://appharbor.com/addons">many add-on supported by AppHarbor</a>, including SQL Server, MongoDB, RavenDB, MySQL, Memcacher &#8230; Many of these ad-ons offer free versions so you can test them for free. If you run into some problems, you can use <a href="http://support.appharbor.com/">the support forums</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/appharbor">StackOverflow</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Flexible deployment</strong></p>

<p>The thing I like best about AppHarbor are the deployment options. You can push your .NET code to AppHarbor using Git, Mercurial, Subversion or Team Foundation Server with the complimentary Git service or through integrations offered in collaboration with <a href="http://support.appharbor.com/kb/api/integrating-with-bitbucket">Bitbucket</a>, <a href="http://support.appharbor.com/kb/api/integrating-with-codeplex">CodePlex</a> and <a href="http://blog.appharbor.com/2011/10/13/announcing-github-support">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>When AppHarbor receives your code it will be built by a platform build server. If the code compiles, any unit tests contained in the compiled assemblies will be run. If the code builds and all tests execute successfully, the application is deployed to the AppHarbor application servers.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>

<p>The majority of .NET code runs just fine in AppHarbor without any changes. If you use Nuget, you need to enabled Nuget Package Restore for your solution.</p>

<p>Let the continous deployment begin &#8230; my first AppHarbor project is hosted at <a href="http://myexpenses.apphb.com/">http://myexpenses.apphb.com</a>.</p>

                        <p>I have been <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/monotouch-ios-development-for-net-programmers/">playing with MonoTouch</a> only for a few days when I already started to miss all the .NET libraries I commonly use. The first one I needed to get working with MonoTouch was <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx">JSON.NET</a>.</p>

<p>MonoDevelop does not support Nuget so you have to get your libaries the old way. I downloaded JSON.NET package from <a href="http://nuget.org/">Nuget.org</a>, but it does not contain a DLL built for Mono. Harldy any Nuget package does. You can reference a DLL built for .NET, MonoDevelop will recognize it and even offer you IntelliSense but your project will not get built.</p>

<p>The right way to get a .NET library working with MonoTouch is downloading its source code and building it yourself. You can use MonoDevelop to build the source codes. The only think you have to do (at least for JSON.NET) is to change the .NET profile to an equivalent Mono profile in the project settings.</p>

                        <p>Beeing <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/why-i-do-not-like-windows-phone-programming-anymore/">quite disappointed with the Windows Phone platform recently</a> I started to look for other ways to use my .NET skills and to develop for a mobile platform at the same time. I found <a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">MonoTouch</a>, a product from Xamarin that allows you to build iOS apps using C# with Mono.</p>

<p><strong>What is MonoTouch?</strong></p>

<p>MonoTouch is a product or a framework do develop iOS apps using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> (an open-source .NET implementation). It allows you to use C# (hopefuly also F# although I have not been able to get it to work yet) and all the .NET features libraries you use and like and of course your existing codebase. No Objective-C knowledge is required, but you will have to learn about the iOS ecosystem an iOS SDK. The iOS SDK is also needed, so you cannot do the development in Windows, you have to use a Mac. There are ways to get MacOS X working on a PC as a native install or in VMWare / VirtualBox, if you just want to try it out, but it may not be legal.</p>

<p><strong>How does the development work?</strong></p>

<p>When using MonoTouch you create a new project in MonoDevelop that comes with MonoTouch. The UI files (*.xib) cannot be modified using MonoDevelop so you have to use XCode. You define your UI in XCode like you would as a native developer, creating outlets and actions. MonoTouch watches the project files you make in XCode and generates matching C# files, that allow you to use all the UI elements created in XCode from your C# code. This method is prefered, but you can create the whole UI in code and never use XCode.</p>

<p><img src="/images/monotocuh.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The iOS development uses MVC pattern, but it does not look like the MVC pattern I am used to. It looks to me more like WinForms development than WPF or other XAML-based technology using MVVM. Just to be clear, MonoTouch would not shield you from the iOS specific stuff, it just porjects the iOS SDK methods and properties to Mono. But it still C# (check out the Write beautiful code section on the <a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">MonoTouch website</a>).</p>

<p>The MonoTouch project compiles to native ARM code.</p>

<p><strong>Should you use it?</strong></p>

<p>That depends. If you are a .NET developer, MonoTouch is definitely the way to do your iOS development. If you will be in a position to decide between native iOS development and MonoTouch, definetely <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1583856/how-to-decide-between-monotouch-and-objective-c">check out this StackOverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>The prices start at $399 for indie developers and companies with less then 10 employees. The evaluation version allows you to develop a full application and test it in the simulator, but you have to have a commercial license to deploy to a real device and to the AppStore.</p>

                        <p>Before I start with the actual arguments I feel a need to state my background first so you do not mistake me with just another hater rattling about things he does not know. I have been a long time .NET developer, I have worked with winforms, webforms, mvc, compact framework. I really like C# and love F#. In February I started to work as a full time Windows Phone developer. Although I have been programming exclusively for Windows 8 for the last few months I have a ton of experience with Windows Phone programming.</p>

<p><strong>Good old Windows Phone 7 times</strong></p>

<p>I really like Windows Phone 7 as a programmer. Although capabilities of this mobile OS are very limited compared to other platforms, the things you can do can be done easily and reliably. The OS is based on Silverlight, which is a mature platform. Everything works as you would expect.</p>

<p><strong>The abomination called Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>When I first got my hands on a Windows Phone 8 phone I was really disappointed. I wrote two concrete post about <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/store-region-messed-up-in-windows-phone-8/">troubles with Windows Phone Store region</a> and an <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/htc-8x-windows-phone-8-and-playing-music/">unaccountable approach to MP3 tags</a> but lets take it more generally. Windows Phone 8 feels like Windows Phone 7 written from scratch using another technology, visually looking nearly the same but full of bugs and unfinished things. I am really amazed at things that worked on Windows Phone 7 but work much worse on Windows Phone 8. I thought that only Czech and Slovak people suffered from the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome but clearly it might be a more widespread disease.</p>

<p>The advocates of throwing away Silverlight and writing everything from scratch always tell you that it allows you to share your code with Windows 8, use the same APIs and program the same way. And they try hard to persuade you that all the Windows Phone 7 apps run great on Windows Phone 8. Neither of this statements are completely true.</p>

<p><strong>Running Windows Phone 7 apps on Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>The majority of Windows Phone 7 apps run ok on Windows Phone 8 but your own app never falls into that ok category. If you do not use any problematic APIs yours will be fine just with replacing all your graphic resources with a twice the size equivalent. And you should definitely do so, because all the icons and backgrounds look ugly scaled up on a high resolution phones like the HTC 8X. The splashcreens also look ugly scaled up but there is nothing you can do about it, a splashscreen in a Windows Phone 7 project must always be 480&#215;800.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206947(v=vs.105).aspx">some API incompatibilities</a> you should be aware of and also some undocumented problems. For instance if you use udp multicast, your application will not work on Windows Phone 8. It will join the multicast group but will neither send nor receive any packets. No error or exception thrown, it just will not work. What is even worse is that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13702991/is-there-a-way-to-opt-out-from-wp8-when-submiting-an-windows-phone-app/">you cannot opt-out from Windows Phone 8</a> in the Windows Phone Store. That means that if you upload your Windows Phone 7 app to the Windows Phone Store and you know that it does not work on Windows Phone 8, there is no way to ban it from being installed on Windows Phone 8 devices. At least no way for you, apps like WhatsApp can do it.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing code between Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>The biggest benefit of throwing away Silverlight and using the same kernel as Windows 8 should be the before-mentioned ability to share code when programming for both platforms. The Windows Phone 8 API is only a subset of the Windows 8 API (WinRT) so you cannot share everything. Take a simple task, downloading a string from the internet. In Windows Phone 7 you would use the WebClient class, in Windows 8 it is not available, so you have to go a bit deeper and use the HttpHandler class. There is no HttpHandler only WebClient so no sharing of code here. I can state many more examples.</p>

<p>Sometimes you find APIs in Windows Phone 8 from phone Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8 and you are very surprised by it (I was). One example can be that to store your app&#8217;s settings you can use IssolatesStorageSettings from Windows Phone 7 and ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings from Windows 8. It is a bit strange you say to yourself and choose to use the latter to be able to share the code with Windows 8. You implement your app using this Windows 8 API, the app compiles without problems and then you run the app. What do you get? A <a href="https://twitter.com/igorkulman/status/276698899689914368">NotImplementedException</a>! This makes me want to punch someone into the face. So why is this included in the API if it is not implemented? It should not be there or at least the compilers should warn you. There are many more Windows 8 APIs that will throw you a NotImplementedException.</p>

<p><strong>New era?</strong></p>

<p>Trying to say something positive; if you are a C++, web or game developer that you can use for skill in Windows Phone 8 programming, if you for some reason decide to target this (to be honest with ourselves) irrelevant mobile platform. If you are a C# developer the Windows Phone 8 development sucks for you. The same can be said about Windows 8 development, where creating a content app in HTML is much easier that trying to bend XAML to your needs (maybe I will write a separate post about this). Quite an interesting twist, would you not say?</p>

                        <p>When navigating in a Windows Store app, you can specify a navigation parameter. This navigation parameter can be any object but there is a problem. When the application is suspended, this navigation parameter is saved by the LayoutAwarePage. This works only with primitive data types, unless you change the implementation of the class which instances you pass as the navigation parameter.</p>

<p>I use mainly ints (article id, gallery id &#8230;) as navigation parameters but sometimes just on int is not enough. If I want to pass two int parameters, I &#8220;encode&#8221; them into an int and then &#8220;decode&#8221; back on the target page. I have a simple Utils class for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>There is no AutoCompleteBox control that can be used when building Windows Store apps in C# and XAML so I decided to create one, because I needed it for a project. Currently it supports only String collections and the selected value must be accessed using code behind, but this will hopefully change.</p>

<p>The AutoCompleteBox uses <a href="http://winrtxamltoolkit.codeplex.com/">WinRT XAML Toolkit</a> to show the watermark and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Reactive Extensions</a> so the users does not need to press enter, the results will show after they stop typing for a second.</p>

<p>The project is hosted on my Bitbucket so you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox">https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox</a>, forks and code contributions are welcomed. Nuget package is available at <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT">https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT</a>.</p>

<p>Installation using Nuget:</p>

                        <p>F# is a great language with a great potential that lets you express yourself more clearly and compactly. One of the best features that comes with F# 3.0 shipped with Visual Studio 2012 is Type Providers.</p>

<p><strong>What are Type Providers?</strong></p>

<p>According to MSDN documentation, an F# type provider is a component that provides types, properties, and methods for use in your program. Type providers are a significant part of F# 3.0 support for information-rich programming. The key to information-rich programming is to eliminate barriers to working with diverse information sources found on the Internet and in modern enterprise environments. One significant barrier to including a source of information into a program is the need to represent that information as types, properties, and methods for use in a programming language environment. Writing these types manually is very time-consuming and difficult to maintain. A common alternative is to use a code generator which adds files to your project; however, the conventional types of code generation do not integrate well into exploratory modes of programming supported by F# because the generated code must be replaced each time a service reference is adjusted.</p>

<p><strong>Available Type Providers</strong></p>

<p>F# comes with Type Providers for SQL, WSDL and OData, but you can also <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361034.aspx">create your own</a> or use one created by the community. A example may be the <a href="http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/2012/08/01/announcing-the-f-r-type-provider/">Type Provider for R</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Using Type Provider for SQL</strong></p>

<p>In this article I will show you how to use the Type Prvoder for SQL. If you want to use SQL with a language like C#, you need to create an EF or LINQ to SQL model from the database and recreate it every time the database schema changes. Type Provider for SQL makes this for you and lets you concentrace on working with the actual data.</p>

<p><strong>Schema information</strong></p>

<p>First you need to define a datasource. The only thing needed for this is a connection string. The connection string can be changed at runtime but you must provide a valid one for the compilation time so the F# compiler can &#8220;detect&#8221; the structure of your data. Let us create a module, that will hold our connection string and schema information.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5857569.js"></script></p>

<p>That is everything you need, if the schema of your database changes the F# compiler will notice.</p>

<p><strong>Querying the database</strong></p>

<p>With the schema information in place we can now start querying the database. We will create a Factory class with the connection string as a parameter</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5857575.js"></script></p>

<p>Now create a method, write db. and wait for a moment. IntelliSense will show you all the available tables in the database. If you query a table and write a dot again, you will be shown all the columns of the table. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>You can query the database using the query { expression }, where expression is a normal F# expression, for example</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5857577.js"></script></p>

<p>Notice how the IntelliSense offers you a complete list of the columns if you write d. in the where clause.</p>

<p><strong>Inserting and updating data</strong></p>

<p>Inserting data is basically identical to the C# approach when using LINQ to SQL</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5857579.js"></script></p>

<p>The same is true for updating the data</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5857580.js"></script></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion, Type Providers are the best feature of F# so far. It is a real shame that Microsoft does not push this language and it cannot be used everywhere where C# can. But things are getting better and you can now create an F# Worker Role in your Azure project.</p>

<p>If you are new to F# and want to learn in, definitely check out the <a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org/">Try F# project</a>.</p>

                        <p>I use my Nokia Lumia 800 also as a music player, with a few annoyances but nothing I could not live with. When I tried to use the HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8 as a music player, the situation was quite different.</p>

<p>The first thing that annoys me is more of a HTC&#8217;s fault than Windows Phone&#8217;s. The HTC 8X has Beats Audio. It does not really say what it is or does, it just says it is there. Every time you plug in your headset, a notification sound is played and a toast appears informing you that the Beats Audio is on. You can disable the sound only using the disable all other notifications option in settings, so you may loose some notifications you need. Disabling the toast is impossible. I naively thought that if I disable the Beats Audio completely the notification goes away. Silly me. The notifications just changes from Beats Audio on to Beats Audio off every damn time you plug in your headset.</p>

<p>The thing I really hate and makes me unable to use Windows Phone 8 as a music player is the music app&#8217;s (I guess it is called XBOX Music) ignorance to my ID3 tags. I copied one album to the phone&#8217;s Music directory in explorer. All the songs from this album had ID3 v1 and v2 filled in. The music app recognized it as some bullshit album with unknown artist and unknown song names and downloaded an american flag on blue curtain as its cover. Windows Phone 7 had no problem recognizing it, neither had Zune. I had the same issue with almost every other album I copied to the phone.</p>

<p>I deleted all the albums using explorer, but they did not disappear from the music app. I could not find a way to delete them from the library. I even installed the terrible synchronization app but the song records could not be deleted using it either. The only thing that helped was a complete reset of the phone deleting all the data.</p>

<p>If anyone knows how to make the music app on Windows Phone 8 behave as a user would expect, please let me know. If it is possible at all.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks to Radek Hulán (in comments) I was able to solve it. Windows Phone 8 does not support ID3 2.4 like every other sofware just 2.3. You need to convert all your 2.4 tags to 2.3 with a software like <a href="http://www.mp3tag.de/en/">MP3Tag</a>. If you want to sync by albums, you cannot do that, you need to create a playlist for each album. It looks like the usability and ease of use got reimagined.</p>

                        <p>If you use Windows Phone 7, your region for the Windows Phone Store is determined by the region of your Live ID you use with the phone. The region of your Live ID cannot be changed, so if you move to another country or just want to access apps that are not available in your country there is nothing you can to about it. Changing region in your phone does not help.</p>

<p>The situation in Windows Phone 8 is different, more messed up. When I got my hands on the HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8, I logged with my Slovak LiveID. The Windows Phone Store showed apps available in Slovakia and I had no access to music or podcasts as expected. I listen to podcasts every day so I have an US Live ID I use with my Lumia 800 (and nowhere else and cannot be &#8220;merged&#8221; with my primary Live ID).</p>

<p>I did a reset on the HTC 8X and logged with my US LiveID. I set the region in the phone to Slovakia. When I opened the Windows Phone Store, podcasts and music were there so I was satisfied. I started to browse the apps section and it seemed strange. I could not find the apps I use on my Lumia 800 with the same Live ID. These apss are not available in Slovakia. When I changed the region setting in the phone to US, then the Store started to show them.</p>

<p>To sum it up, it looks like in Windows Phone 8 the services that are available to you (apps, games, music, podcasts) are determined from the region of your Live ID, but the games and apps that are shown to you are determined from the region setting in your phone. Pretty messed up if you ask me.</p>
