                       <p>Some time ago I needed a way to programatically search the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store to get some info about apps for a project. I decided to write an F# script for that task and later added support for Windows Phone Store.</p>

<p><strong>Types</strong></p>

<p>I wanted the script to be easily usable from outside of F# so first I created a type for the app.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=types.fs"></script>

<p>I also needed a helper function to download data from the web. I used a classic WebClient with user agent set to Chrome, because the Windows Phone Store API requires a user agent header</p>

                       <p>[FAKE][1] is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) so that you can start using it without learning F#. If you need more than the default functionality you can either write F# or simply reference .NET assemblies.</p>

<p>I have been using FAKE for quite some time now on some fairly complex projects for not only building but also running tests and creating and pushing Nuget packages and I really like. I decided to add FAKE build scripts to my Windows Phone apps to make the process of generating a XAP file for the Windows Phone Store easier.</p>

<p>The FAKE script I use can by used with any Windows Phone app, it will build all the projects and copy the XAP file to a release directory.</p>

                       <p>If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator).</p>

<img src="/images/line.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone Store does not offer developers any sandbox to test in-app purchases in their apps, like stores on other platforms do. If you want test in-app purchases in your Windows Phone apps, you need to use other options.</p>

<p>To make in-app purchases implementation easier, I created a simple Windows Phone Store service interface in my [Kulman.WP8][1] library (also [available on Nuget][2])</p>

                       <p>Recently I have released a new Windows Phone app called [Pock8][1]. Pock8 is a beautiful Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client for Windows Phone. The design of the app was created by Jan Marek who worked with my on the [Shopping List Simple][2] app.</p>

<img src="/images/pocket.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>Our goal was to create a Pocket client that would be really easy to use and that would have a nice and simple design. I think we have achieved our goal. The main features of the app are</p>

<ul>
<li>clean and simple design</li>
<li>optimized article view for comfortable reading</li>
<li>article cache for offline reading</li>
<li>dark theme for OLED screens or reading in the dark</li>
<li>support for receiving articles from other apps like WPCentral</li>
<li>listening to articles aloud</li>
<li>sharing articles</li>
</ul>

                       <p>If you develop mobile or any other kinds of apps, you need to have your source code versioned and stored in a safe place, cooperate with other people, track information about the usage of your apps and track all the errors that may occur. There are many free services that may help you with those tasks. In this article I will give you a list of the ones I use when developing [my apps][1].</p>

<p><strong>Bitbucket: source control and issue tracker</strong></p>

<p>I use Git as my source control system and all my private repos are stored at [Bitbucket]<a href="public at [GitHub][3]">2</a>. Bitbucket offers unlimited number of private repos and cooperation with up to 5 other people for free.</p>

<p>For each private repo you can create a private issue tracker also for free, so all your code and issues are at the same place. The main advantage is that source control and issue tracker are connected, so you can comment or close issues directly from Git commits.</p>

                       <p>In a recent larger ASP.NET MVC project running in Windows Azure I needed to provide the advanced users a way to execute custom scripts directly through the webbrowser. A kind of a scripting console where users can create and execute their own scripts, that interact with the project and automate some tasks (that would otherwise require too many clicks).</p>

<p><strong>Choosing the language</strong></p>

<p>I thought about using Lua but I needed an easy way to integrate with some classes (repositories) used in the project. I decided to use C# as the scripting language and implement the scripting console using [Roslyn][1]. Roslyn is a really neat project and I recommend taking a look at it, if you do not already know it.</p>

<p>I extracted the main idea of my implementation of the scripting console and [posted it on GitHub][2]. I will walk you through it in this blog post.</p>

                       <p>Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time).</p>

<p>You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use [Reactive Extensions][1]. You can use Reactive Extensions directly on a TextBox representing the Search box, but if you use MVVM (and you should) you need to attach to the property associated with the Search box instead.</p>

<p>Suppose the ViewModel contains a string property called SearchTerm (with two-way binding to the Search box) and an event called PropertyChanged (used for the INotifyPropertyChanged implementation). We need to observe the changes of the SearchTerm property. There is no way to do it directly, we need to observe the PropertyChanged event instead.</p>

                       <p>When debugging a C# program in Visual Studio, I tend to always hover over the variables to glance at their values and structure instead of explicitly writing their names into the watch window. If I want to explore say a collection, I need to unfold each of the items using the + button to get an idea about the data:</p>

<img src="/images/debug1.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>This is not very comfortable, so thankfully, there is a way to make this experience better, using the [DebuggerDisplay][2] attribute. This attribute can be applied to any class (and struct, enum, property, field, delegate, assembly) and allows you to define the information about the class you wanto to see in the debugger.</p>
