                       <p>This blog post is inspired by the [7 open-source Visual Studio Extensions to make your life easier][1] article. In the article Igal Tabachnik showed his favorite Visual Studio extensions, that were quite interesting. I also use a few Visual Studio extensions that make my life easier, so I decided to share.</p>

<p><strong>[Indent Guides][2]</strong></p>

<p>Small and simple extension with just one task, displaying indent and page width guides in Visual Studio text editor windows. There are three styles of guides: solid, dotted and dashed, available in thin and thick varieties and customizable color.</p>

                       <p>By default, Visual Studio shows the name of the opened solution name in the title. This makes it easier to navigate among multiple instances of Visual Studio. You see the solution name next to the Visual Studio icon in the taskbar and also in the task manager, when you have to (and we all sometimes have to) kill the right Visual Studio because it stopped responding.</p>

<p>I work with Git, switching branches frequently, especially working on features and bug fixes. In this situation, it would be nice if Visual Studio showed not only the solution name but also the current branch in its title. No problem, there is an extension for that.</p>

<p>The extension is called [Rename Visual Studio Window][1] and it works with Visual Studio 2015, 2013, 2012, 2010. This extension supports Git, so you can easily add the branch name to the title with a config like mine using [gitBranchName].</p>

                       Sometimes you cannot influence the design of the API you have to use and wonder, why the API uses so strangely serialized DateTime and how to handle it using JSON.NET. Luckily, JSON.NET makes plugging in custom serializers / deserializes quite easy. There are a few base classes to help you write your own converter, when dealing with DateTime you want to inherit the DateTimeConverterBase class. There are two methods in this class to override, WriteJson and ReadJson.

                       I have been owning and using a Raspberry Pi for over a year now. I started with Raspberry Pi model B and now I added Raspberry Pi 2 immediately after it was announced. Thanks to the fact that an IoT version of Windows 10 will run on the Pi, there is quite a hype about the Pi 2. Many people who did not care about the Pi before are now buying it because of that hype.

                       When debugging a C# program in Visual Studio, I tend to always hover over the variables to glance at their values and structure instead of explicitly writing their names into the watch window. If I want to explore say a collection, I need to unfold each of the items using the + button to get an idea about the data: This is not very comfortable, so thankfully, there is a way to make this experience better, using the DebuggerDisplay attribute.

                       I have recently come across an intreresting project by Syncfusion, a company providing software components for the Microsoft platform. The have created a series of books for programmes called the Succinctly series. The goal of the series is to create 50-100 pages ebooks covering various topics. Each book should give you an introduction to the topic inc a succint way, so you do not have to read thick books or spend time finding relevant blog post covering the selected topic.

                       Uploading a file in ASP.NET MVC is very easy, but there is no easy way to detect the encoding of a uploaded text file. However you can use the fact if you try to read the file with a wrong encoding, you get an DecoderFallbackException. So how do you put everything together? First, get a stream of the uploaded file. Next, read the whole file to a byte array Finally

                       While reading an article that had nothing in common with programming I came upon a sudden need to find a way to generate all the permutations of a list, or more exactly a string (it is just a list of characters). As lazy as I am I tried to google a few examples of C# code that does exactly that. I was horrified that programmers could come up with the complicated ways I found.

                       If you want to host your .NET project on the Internet, there are classic ASP.NET webhosting on one side of the spectrum and Microsoft Azure on the other. If you are looking for something in the middle, take a look at AppHarbor. AppHarbor AppHarbor is a flexible and scalable .NET Platform-as-a-Service, that you can even use for free, limited to one web or worker role. It runs in AWS and is quite similiar to Heroku.

                       Gamification is a great concept that works really well for some people, including me. Gamification may very well be the reason for success of projects like StackOveflow or Duolingo. Visual Studio Achievements Visual Studio Achievements is Visual Studio plugin that rewards you for good practices like having 1000 localized values (Localization Master) and even for bad practices like writin a single line of 300 characters long (Scroll Bar Wizard). For some of the achievements you need to have FxCop installed, but the majority get awareded without the need for it.
