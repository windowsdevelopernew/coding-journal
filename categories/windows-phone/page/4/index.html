                       If you develop Windows Phone, Windows 8, Silverlight or WPF apps using the MVVM pattern, you are familiar with the INotifyPropertyChanged interface. Typical implementation In a typical implementation, you usually have a base class implementing the interface, like or use a framework like MVVMLight, Prism or Caliburn Micro that provides such base class for you. In your view models you have properties using the PropertyChanged method You do not need to create such properties by hand, you can use a snippet, but it is still a lot of code to do such a simple thing.

                       When I released version 2.0 of my app Photo Timeline, some users reported updating problems. I finally found out what caused the problem and submited a new build to the Windows Phone store. In my app I had three localizations: en-US (default), en and cs. I do not exactly remember why I had English twice as localization. I decided to remove the en localization thinking that nothing will break and that was a mistake.

                       I have been a Windows Phone developer for over a year now and my paid apps made me some money. The small amount of money made is not interesting, more interesting is that getting the money from Microsoft has been a real pain. Maybe because I live outside the US, maybe it is a geographically independent problem. If you are a developer and live outside the US, I really want to hear your experience.

                       I recently discovered two really neet tools that helped me with Windows Store app development. Windows Store Icon Maker When creating a Windows Store or Windows 8 apps, there are many icon sizes you have to provide. If you do nont wat to do all the resizing by yourself, you can use the Windows Store Icon Maker. It is a fork of the Windows Phone Icons Maker with added support for Windows Store apps.

                       If you create a Windows Phone app and you want it to be able to run on both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, you target Windows Phone 7 and the app runs on Windows Phone 8 automatically. But is it really enough to create a Windows Phone 7 buíld? Not if you want to create a really well designed app. The problem with Windows Phone 8 from a designers point of view is that it introduces two new display resolutions.

                       I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget. Windows Phone Code: https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP7 Nuget: https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP7/ Windows 8 Code: https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WinRT Nuget: https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WinRT My Windows 8 mini-library is best used with the WinRTXAMLToolkit that I contributed to once ot twice.

                       Passing the certification in Windows Phone Store and Windows Store can be a very painful process, but after a few tries you get enough experience to pass your apps on the first try. You may sometimes get a tester who is really dumb and fails your app for a made up reason but usually it is just enough to submit it again so another testers gets to test it. Lately I have been seeing a strange shift in the testing quality done in the certification process.

                       Windows Phone allows yout to use custom TTF fonts in your apps. Using a custom font from XAML or C# is easy, but your run into troubles when you want to use if from a Background Agent (e.g: for updating a Live Tile). Adding font to solution The custom font must be a TTF, you can also use a ZIP file with multiple TTF files. You need to know the name of the font to identify it.

                       Before I start with the actual arguments I feel a need to state my background first so you do not mistake me with just another hater rattling about things he does not know. I have been a long time .NET developer, I have worked with winforms, webforms, mvc, compact framework. I really like C# and love F#. In February I started to work as a full time Windows Phone developer. Although I have been programming exclusively for Windows 8 for the last few months I have a ton of experience with Windows Phone programming.

                       I use my Nokia Lumia 800 also as a music player, with a few annoyances but nothing I could not live with. When I tried to use the HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8 as a music player, the situation was quite different. The first thing that annoys me is more of a HTC&#8217;s fault than Windows Phone&#8217;s. The HTC 8X has Beats Audio. It does not really say what it is or does, it just says it is there.
