                       <p>Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time).</p>

<p>You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use [Reactive Extensions][1]. You can use Reactive Extensions directly on a TextBox representing the Search box, but if you use MVVM (and you should) you need to attach to the property associated with the Search box instead.</p>

<p>Suppose the ViewModel contains a string property called SearchTerm (with two-way binding to the Search box) and an event called PropertyChanged (used for the INotifyPropertyChanged implementation). We need to observe the changes of the SearchTerm property. There is no way to do it directly, we need to observe the PropertyChanged event instead.</p>

                       <p>In both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 the background agent is executed approximately every 30 minutes. If you want to run your code more often, for example to create an app showing actual time on the live tile, you are out of luck. Are you?</p>

<p>You can use [ScheduledActionService.LaunchForTest][1] to test your background agent without waiting 30 minutes for the system to run it. What if you use this method in the OnInvoke method of your background agent?</p>

                       <p>If you develop Windows Phone, Windows 8, Silverlight or WPF apps using the MVVM pattern, you are familiar with the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.</p>

<p><strong>Typical implementation</strong></p>

<p>In a typical implementation, you usually have a base class implementing the interface, like</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5849361.js"></script>

<p>or use a framework like MVVMLight, Prism or Caliburn Micro that provides such base class for you. In your view models you have properties using the PropertyChanged method</p>

                       <p>When I released version 2.0 of my app [Photo Timeline][1], some users reported updating problems. I finally found out what caused the problem and submited a new build to the Windows Phone store.</p>

<p>In my app I had three localizations: en-US (default), en and cs. I do not exactly remember why I had English twice as localization. I decided to remove the en localization thinking that nothing will break and that was a mistake.</p>

<p><strong>Once you add a localization to your app, never remove it!</strong> If you do so, all the users who use your app with that localization will have update problems.</p>

                       <p>I have been a Windows Phone developer for over a year now and my paid apps made me some money. The small amount of money made is not interesting, more interesting is that getting the money from Microsoft has been a real pain. Maybe because I live <strong>outside the US</strong>, maybe it is a geographically independent problem. If you are a developer and live outside the US, I really want to hear your experience.</p>

<p><strong>No exact info about payment rules?</strong></p>

<p>First, there is no exact information about how often a developer gets paid. The [getting paid section][1] in the Windows Phone Dev Center only informs you about tax and bank info, that you need to provide to get paid. I remember that I once heard that developers get paid when their earnings get pass $200, but I was not able to get any official info about this. The first payment I got from Windows Phone Store was $52.50 and I know a developer with $900 earned and no money sent to him, so I guess the $200 limit is not true.</p>

<p>The [$200 limit should be true for Windows Store][2], but Windows Phone Store is a different store with different rules.</p>

                       <p>I recently discovered two really neet tools that helped me with Windows Store app development.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Store Icon Maker</strong></p>

<p>When creating a Windows Store or Windows 8 apps, there are many icon sizes you have to provide. If you do nont wat to do all the resizing by yourself, you can use the [Windows Store Icon Maker][1]. It is a fork of the [Windows Phone Icons Maker][2] with added support for Windows Store apps. It takes a 300x300px icon as input and outputs all the square icons you need.</p>

                       <p>If you create a Windows Phone app and you want it to be able to run on both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, you target Windows Phone 7 and the app runs on Windows Phone 8 automatically. But is it really enough to create a Windows Phone 7 buíld? Not if you want to create a really well designed app.</p>

<p>The problem with Windows Phone 8 from a designers point of view is that it introduces two new display resolutions. Windows Phone 7 supports just one resolution, WVGA of 800x480px. Windows Phone 8 adds WXGA (1280&#215;768) and 720p (1280&#215;720). If you run your Windows Phone 7 app on a WXGA device, the app is proportionally scaled by a factor of 1.6 to fill out the whole screen. As long as you provide all your images scaled by the same factor, the app looks ok.</p>

<p>The problem is 720p, because it is a different aspect ratio (16:9 vs 15:9). Your Windows Phone 7 app running on a 720p app is first scaled by a factor of 1.5 to 1200&#215;720 and the rest of the display (80px) is padded on top or bottom, depending on the VerticalAlignment. By default, the padding is added to the top of your app making your header 80px higher:</p>

                       <p>I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget.</p>

                       <p>Passing the certification in Windows Phone Store and Windows Store can be a very painful process, but after a few tries you get enough experience to pass your apps on the first try. You may sometimes get a tester who is really dumb and fails your app for a made up reason but usually it is just enough to submit it again so another testers gets to test it. Lately I have been seeing a strange shift in the testing quality done in the certification process.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Phone Store</strong></p>

<p>The certification process used to discover bugs I overlooked, so it was quite useful sometimes. But it is not anymore. Let me give you an example. I wanted to change one of my Windows Phone apps from free to paid with a 3 day trial. I have this functionality implemented in another of my apps so I simply copied the trial page, set is as the start page. I tested it in trial mode, it showed, in purchased mode, the app showed the real start page. I was under the impression that everything worked just fine.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone allows yout to use custom TTF fonts in your apps. Using a custom font from XAML or C# is easy, but your run into troubles when you want to use if from a Background Agent (e.g: for updating a Live Tile).</p>

<p><strong>Adding font to solution</strong></p>

<p>The custom font must be a TTF, you can also use a ZIP file with multiple TTF files. You need to know the name of the font to identify it. Add the font file to your solution and set its build action to Content.</p>

<p><strong>Custom font and XAML</strong></p>

<p>Using a custom font in XAML is very straightforward. You just need to set the <em>FontFamily</em> property to the font file path followed by a hash (#) and the font name:</p>
