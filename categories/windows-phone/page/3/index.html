                       Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again).

                       Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my Pock8 app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE).

                       FAKE is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) so that you can start using it without learning F#. If you need more than the default functionality you can either write F# or simply reference .NET assemblies. I have been using FAKE for quite some time now on some fairly complex projects for not only building but also running tests and creating and pushing Nuget packages and I really like.

                       If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator). I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1. Doing this in XAML for every page is not very convenient, a better solution

                       Getting contacts info on Windows Phone means using a callback based API provided by the Windows Phone SDK I really dislike all the callback-based API so I was looking for a way to convert it to an async/await based API. And it is quite easy to do so You can find this implementation in my Kulman.WP8 library (also available on Nuget)

                       Windows Phone Store does not offer developers any sandbox to test in-app purchases in their apps, like stores on other platforms do. If you want test in-app purchases in your Windows Phone apps, you need to use other options. To make in-app purchases implementation easier, I created a simple Windows Phone Store service interface in my Kulman.WP8 library (also available on Nuget) Private beta If you publish your app as a private beta and add the in-app products, you can test them.

                       Recently I have released a new Windows Phone app called Pock8. Pock8 is a beautiful Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client for Windows Phone. The design of the app was created by Jan Marek who worked with my on the Shopping List Simple app. Our goal was to create a Pocket client that would be really easy to use and that would have a nice and simple design. I think we have achieved our goal.

                       If you develop mobile or any other kinds of apps, you need to have your source code versioned and stored in a safe place, cooperate with other people, track information about the usage of your apps and track all the errors that may occur. There are many free services that may help you with those tasks. In this article I will give you a list of the ones I use when developing my apps.

                       Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time). You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use Reactive Extensions.

                       In both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 the background agent is executed approximately every 30 minutes. If you want to run your code more often, for example to create an app showing actual time on the live tile, you are out of luck. Are you? You can use ScheduledActionService.LaunchForTest to test your background agent without waiting 30 minutes for the system to run it. What if you use this method in the OnInvoke method of your background agent?
