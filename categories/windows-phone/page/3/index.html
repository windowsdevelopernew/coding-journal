                        <p>Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again). Ignoring certificate errors would be a much more comfortable approach. Of course, only do it in development with dev servers, not in production.</p>

<p>In Windows Phone 8.1 there are strangely two HttpClient classes, one in System.Net.Http and another in Windows.Web.Http. Normally you would go with the one in System.Net.Http because you are probably using it thanks to the mentioned Portable HTTP Client Libraries on every other platform. You are out of luck in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, if you want to ignore certificate errors, you have to use the one from Windows.Web.Http, because only this one accepts an IHttpFilter as an argument.</p>

<p>Using the IHttpFilter, you can easily ignore certificate errors</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/76c9d8f1e79b6fd41c33.js"></script></p>

<p>but you have to get used to doing all the request in a different way, the Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient way that differs from the System.Net.Http.HttpClient way.</p>

                        <p>Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my <a href="http://t.co/YMtrM84rwI">Pock8</a> app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE). This makes the app even more easy to use and valuable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp81.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The problem is that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh871367.aspx">all the documentation I found</a> and also <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh871363.aspx">the sample app</a> are for Windows Runtime. Pock8 is a Silverligt app and I have no intentions to rewrite it to Windows Runtime.</p>

<p>I had to make some digging and I finally found the solution in a build video called <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-520">Contracts and Pickers: Building Apps that Work Together on Windows</a>.</p>

<p>First you have to add the <strong>Share Contract</strong> ability to the new manifest file (Package.appxmanifest, the Declarations tab). If you want to receive links, Choose <strong>weblink</strong> as data format. This step is the same for Windows Runtime and for Silverlight apps, but all the other steps differ.</p>

<p>You can determine if your application was launched normally or as a Share Contract target in the application Launching event. If you cast the <strong>LaunchingEventArgs</strong> to <strong>ShareLaunchingEventArgs</strong> and the result is not null, your application was launched as a Share Contract target. The video recommend creating an internal property of type <strong>ShareOperation</strong> in App.xaml.cs and saving the data from <strong>ShareLaunchingEventArgs</strong> there:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/11111043.js?file=AssociationUriMapper.cs"></script>

<p>(I use Caliburn.Micro so I do it in the OnLaunch method of the Bootstrapper)</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to show a separate sharing page instead of the page you would normally show when your app starts. Create a <strong>AssociationUriMapper</strong> like you <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206987(v=vs.105).aspx">would do when registering for a protocol</a> and simply check the <strong>ShareOperation</strong> property in App.xaml.cs:</p>

<p>If you use Caliburn.Micro as I do, do not forget to register the AssociationUriMapper in the Boostrappers CreatePhoneApplicationFrame method:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/11111043.js?file=CreatePhoneApplicationFrame.cs"></script>

                        <p><a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/">FAKE</a> is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) so that you can start using it without learning F#. If you need more than the default functionality you can either write F# or simply reference .NET assemblies.</p>

<p>I have been using FAKE for quite some time now on some fairly complex projects for not only building but also running tests and creating and pushing Nuget packages and I really like. I decided to add FAKE build scripts to my Windows Phone apps to make the process of generating a XAP file for the Windows Phone Store easier.</p>

<p>The FAKE script I use can by used with any Windows Phone app, it will build all the projects and copy the XAP file to a release directory.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9842235.js?file=build.fsx"></script>

<p>To get the script started, you need a batch file</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9842235.js?file=build.bat"></script>

<p>and Nuget.exe in tools\NuGet directory.</p>

                        <p>If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator).</p>

<p><img src="/images/line.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9572347.js?file=line.xaml"></script>

<p>Doing this in XAML for every page is not very convenient, a better solution would be to set the negative top margin on the whole application frame</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9572347.js?file=line.cs"></script>

<p>If you use Caliburn.Micro, you need to override the CreatePhoneApplicationFrame in the Bootstrapper instead</p>

                        <p>Windows Phone Store does not offer developers any sandbox to test in-app purchases in their apps, like stores on other platforms do. If you want test in-app purchases in your Windows Phone apps, you need to use other options.</p>

<p>To make in-app purchases implementation easier, I created a simple Windows Phone Store service interface in my <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8">Kulman.WP8</a> library (also <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP8/">available on Nuget</a>)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9571908.js?file=IWindowsPhoneStoreService.cs"></script>

<p><strong>Private beta</strong></p>

<p>If you publish your app as a private beta and add the in-app products, you can test them. All the in-app purchases are always free in this scenario. The disadvantage is that you cannot debug anything, it either works or it does not (if you use my <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8/blob/master/Kulman.WP8/Services/WindowsPhoneStoreService.cs">implementation from Kulman.WP8</a>, it should :).</p>

<p><strong>Real app testing</strong></p>

<p>If your app is already in the Windows Phone Store, create an in-app product and try to buy it from your app run from Visual Studio, you may be wondering, why you are getting an error. The problem is that the app run from Visual Studio has a different app id from the app in Windows Phone Store. If you change the app id in the manifest to the app id state in Windows Phone Store (the details view), you will be able to make a real in-app purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Mocking library</strong></p>

<p>To mock in-app purchases you can use the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wpapps/Mock-In-App-Purchase-33080f0c">Mock In-App Purchase Library</a>. To make testing easier, implement my interface using this library</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/9571846.js"></script></p>

<p>And setup the products you want to use at your app startup</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9571908.js?file=SetupMockIAP.cs"></script>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that you just switch the IWindowsStoreService implementation between then mock on and the <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8/blob/master/Kulman.WP8/Services/WindowsPhoneStoreService.cs">real one</a>, depending on the situation. For example (Caliburn.Micro Bootstrapper)</p>

                        <p>Recently I have released a new Windows Phone app called <a href="http://t.co/YMtrM84rwI">Pock8</a>. Pock8 is a beautiful Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client for Windows Phone. The design of the app was created by Jan Marek who worked with my on the <a href="http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=b2667b3c-9272-4416-b0be-c8adadc651e4">Shopping List Simple</a> app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pocket.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>Our goal was to create a Pocket client that would be really easy to use and that would have a nice and simple design. I think we have achieved our goal. The main features of the app are</p>

<ul>
<li>clean and simple design</li>
<li>optimized article view for comfortable reading</li>
<li>article cache for offline reading</li>
<li>dark theme for OLED screens or reading in the dark</li>
<li>support for receiving articles from other apps like WPCentral</li>
<li>listening to articles aloud</li>
<li>sharing articles</li>
</ul>

<p>In version 1.2 we really concentrated on user feedback and added many features that our users requested. We love and users and want to make them happy.</p>

<p>The app is free to use with one limitation, all the list display just 5 articles at any time. You can use an in-app purchase to get rid of the limitation and support further development of the app.</p>

<p>For more info about <a href="http://t.co/YMtrM84rwI">Pock8</a>, follow the app on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/pock8app">@pock8app</a>.</p>

                        <p>If you develop mobile or any other kinds of apps, you need to have your source code versioned and stored in a safe place, cooperate with other people, track information about the usage of your apps and track all the errors that may occur. There are many free services that may help you with those tasks. In this article I will give you a list of the ones I use when developing <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Igor%2BKulman&amp;appId=c00715a7-d2d4-48c1-94e2-2ecc7c1b798b">my apps</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bitbucket: source control and issue tracker</strong></p>

<p>I use Git as my source control system and all my private repos are stored at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> (public at <a href="http://github.com/igorkulman">GitHub</a>). Bitbucket offers unlimited number of private repos and cooperation with up to 5 other people for free.</p>

<p>For each private repo you can create a private issue tracker also for free, so all your code and issues are at the same place. The main advantage is that source control and issue tracker are connected, so you can comment or close issues directly from Git commits.</p>

<p><strong>Flurry: mobile analytics</strong></p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.flurry.com/flurry-analytics.html">Flurry Analytics</a> to track the usage of my apps. Flurry supports Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8 and Blackberry. The tool is completely free and allows you to track events like app runs, unique users, page views or custom events with parameters. Tracking custom events with parameters is really handy, for example thanks to it I know how many users use which color theme in my Shopping List Simple app.</p>

<p><strong>BugSense: bug tracking</strong></p>

<p>Flurry also offers bug tracking, it is no very well done and you cannot get much use of it. To track application crashes and caught exceptions I use <a href="http://bugsense.com/">BugSense</a>. BugSense supports Android, iOS, HTML5, Windows Phone and Windows 8 apps.</p>

<p>Each logged error (exception) provides a complete stracktrace, number of occurrences and detailed info about each instance, like app version, phone model, country, etc. BugSense can be connected to GitHub, Bitbucket is no supported. Maybe in the future.</p>

<p>BugSense is a really useful service that can help you easily identify problems in your apps. Free version offers you 7 days bug info retention for up to 500 different errors for unlimited amount of apps.</p>

                        <p>Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time).</p>

<p>You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Reactive Extensions</a>. You can use Reactive Extensions directly on a TextBox representing the Search box, but if you use MVVM (and you should) you need to attach to the property associated with the Search box instead.</p>

<p>Suppose the ViewModel contains a string property called SearchTerm (with two-way binding to the Search box) and an event called PropertyChanged (used for the INotifyPropertyChanged implementation). We need to observe the changes of the SearchTerm property. There is no way to do it directly, we need to observe the PropertyChanged event instead.</p>

<p>We need to create an observable from the PropertyChanged event, subscribe to it filtering only the PropertyChanged calls regarding the SearchTerm property, throttling for 0.5 seconds</p>

<p>Using the throttle operator we will get exactly the desired behaviour of executing the Search method 0.5 seconds after the user stopped typing.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/7657908.js"></script></p>

<p>However, there is a small problem. The SearchTerm property changes (and fires the PropertyChanged event) only when the Search box loses focus. We need to make the SearchTerm property change after each letter typed instead. In WPF that would be trivial using UpdateTrigger, but Windows Phone does not support UpdateTrigger.</p>

<p>We need to create a custom binding utility</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/7657969.js"></script></p>

<p>and apply it to the Search box</p>

                        <p>In both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 the background agent is executed approximately every 30 minutes. If you want to run your code more often, for example to create an app showing actual time on the live tile, you are out of luck. Are you?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windowsphone/develop/microsoft.phone.scheduler.scheduledactionservice.launchfortest(v=vs.105).aspx">ScheduledActionService.LaunchForTest</a> to test your background agent without waiting 30 minutes for the system to run it. What if you use this method in the OnInvoke method of your background agent?</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849356.js"></script></p>

<p>Your background agent gets executed every minute! I <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CSWP7ScheduledTaskAgent.zip">created a simple demo</a> so you can see for yourself.</p>

<p>I wonder if this code would pass certification. Has anyone tried to use it?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> it will <strong>not</strong> work, see <a href="http://blog.mjfnet.com/2013/01/10/windows-phone-dont-call-launchfortest-in-release/">Windows Phone: Don’t call LaunchForTest in Release</a>.</p>
