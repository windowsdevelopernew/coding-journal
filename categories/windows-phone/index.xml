      <title>Mobilize.net: Converting Windows Phone 8 apps to UWP? Not really</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/mobilize-net-converting-windows-phone-apps-to-uwp</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2015 09:29:12 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft announced the Windows 10 developer platform, they also announced bridges to make porting apps from Android, iOS and Web easier. Those bridges are now either dead (Android) or unusable (iOS) but there is another tool that can be considered a bridge left. It is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobilize.net/download-silverlight-bridge&#34;&gt;Mobilize.net Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; Bridge and it is not from Microsoft. It promises converting existing Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight apps) to the Universal Windows Platform. Considering the majority of apps in the Windows Phone Store are Windows Phone 8 apps and the fact that Android and iOS developers do not really care about Windows, Mobilize.net seem to be the most useful of the bridges, because there is no easy porting apps from Windows Phone 8 to UWP, just rewriting. So I tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/Windows10-Devices.png?t=1449725816496&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=210&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobilize.net is currently in technical preview. After you download and install it, it integrates into Visual Studio 2015 and there is a new context menu for Windows Phone 8 project, allowing you to convert them to UWP apps. If you use it, you get a dialog windows and a conversion process that will fail most of the times with a strange error. At least for me it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in touch with their support and I found out the reason for the conversion always failing. They do not support C# 6 all and mine, and probably all yours, project use C# 6. If you look at the error logs a bit closer, you will see error messages about failed tokenization. This is really strange, it looks like they are parsing the source code as text, instead of just using Roslyn. I do not get why, but they probably have a reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go through all the trouble and remove all the C# 6 features from your project, the conversion will succeed. You will get a UWP project, that will most likely not compile. There are two main reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobilize.net changes your XAML to fix namespaces and replace controls that changed since Windows Phone 8, but it does not fix XAML features that were not available in UWP. And there are quite a few of them, from StringFormat in bindings to OpacityMask on images. You will have to fix your XAML manually and while you are at this, you will also have to rewrite your XAML to accommodate for the fact that there is not just one fixed resolution like it was in Windows Phone 8. Your XAML has to be responsive now. Mobilize.net did not really help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seconds problem are third party libraries. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MobilizeNet/UWPConversionMappings&#34;&gt;some mappings available for popular third party libraries&lt;/a&gt;. This mapping do two things. First they make sure the UWP project uses the correct Nuget packages and then they map namespaces, both in XAML and C#, that changed when the third party library transitioned from Windows Phone 8 to UWP. Chances are that there are no UWP versions of some or even the majority of the third party libraries you use. Probably because the functionality is nor longer available all the API has completely changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to the Mobilize.net support asking about these two things, but I never got an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, if your app is not trivial, you use C# 6, third party libraries and all the available XAML features, your experience will not be very good. If you app is well written (MVVM, abstractions) your are better with creating a new UWP project, pasting your code and rewriting your XAML. If your app is more trivial, Mobilize.net will probably work well for you. But in this case, rewriting your app to UWP without it would be probably takes the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Detecting gestures over WebView on Windows Phone</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/detecting-gestures-over-webview-on-windows-phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 09:29:12 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/detecting-gestures-over-webview-on-windows-phone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you develop Windows Phone apps, you surely had to use the WebView component at least once. Any you must have realized, that it kind of sucks. One of the problems is that it swallows all the gestures and manipulation events. This means you cannot put it into a Pivot, you cannot detect swipe left or right events to navigate to next or previous article .. or can you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent project, I had to implement exactly the mentioned functionality, swiping between articles displayed in a WebView. I did some research and I could not find any solution. So I had to get creative and I find a way involving JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was simple. If you cannot recognize the swipe event over the WebView in your C#/XAML, why not try to recognize them in the WebView? I did some research and found a JavaScript library that works on Windows Phone. The library is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hammerjs.github.io/&#34;&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and it recognizes all the basic gestures, including swiping left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you include Hammer into your HTML, then you set it up to listen over an HTML element and lastly you subscribe to events you are interested in. The only reasonable action you can execute is notify the WebView using the &lt;code&gt;window.external.notify&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/f7c559775ef3e57906ed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C#/XAML part of the solution consists just of handling the WebView&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ScriptNotify&lt;/code&gt; event and implementing your action according to the value you receive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highlighting letters in TextBlock in Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/highlighting-letters-in-textblock-in-windows-phone-8-1-and-windows-8-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/highlighting-letters-in-textblock-in-windows-phone-8-1-and-windows-8-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my current project I had to implement an interesting feature for both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 project of the Universal app. The idea is simply. The users want to search for a movie. They enter a search term into a TextBox and a list of results is shown. The results should have the search term highlighted in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/highlighting.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard TextBlock used to display the movie titles does not support any kind of letter highlighting, so I had to write a custom one. I created a custom UserControl. The UserControl contains a few dependency properties Text, HighlightedText, HighlightBrush and a TextBlock. When Text or HighlightedText change, the Text is then split into multiple Runs that are added to the TextBlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/87b051f2f3a54bf895f0.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole working custom control is available at Github: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WPA81.HighlightTextBox&#34;&gt;https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WPA81.HighlightTextBox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strange combination of HTTPS and Windows Phone 8.1 that can make your app and phone freeze</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/strange-combination-of-https-and-windows-phone-8-1-that-can-make-your-app-and-phone-freeze/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/strange-combination-of-https-and-windows-phone-8-1-that-can-make-your-app-and-phone-freeze/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I came upon a really bizarre problem that you may also find interesting. Lets start with a bit of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;Dr&lt;/strong&gt;: There seems to be a bug in Windows phone 8.1 that can make your app and the phone freezes when displaying images over HTTPS from some servers. Skip to &lt;a href=&#34;#bug&#34;&gt;the end of this article&lt;/a&gt; to see a video and get the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Windows Phone app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is a Windows Phone 8 shopping app for the biggest Czech online retailer. The main screen of the app contains quite a bit of data, usually about ten carousel with about 10 products and the list of main categories, so about 10 more images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In worst case the main screen contains over 10 hundred images. It was quite a hassle to make it work well in the Windows Phone 8 SDK (no, rewriting a shopping about with about 70 screens to Windows Phone 8.1 is not feasible). But it work juts fine. Until last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, users started to report that the app freezes on the main screen, sometime making the whole phone freeze. This was really bad. Frozen app means not only angry customers but customer that do not buy stuff. So I started to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I thought there may be a problem in the app, although the app was last updated more than a month ago and the problem started only last week. Everything worked fine in the emulator, the problem was reproducible only on real devices. I tried showing only one carousel to make the app render much less data, did not help. I tried making the app show only one product in the only one carousel, still a problem. So it looked like the images were the problem. I tried replacing all the real image urls with random images from &lt;a href=&#34;http://lorempixel.com&#34;&gt;lorempixel.com&lt;/a&gt; and the app worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I determined that the source of the problems are the images on the server. Talking with the server customer&amp;#8217;s people I found out that the images on the server were exchanged for bigger one because of the iPhones. But it did not make sense. I tried using much bigger random images and the app worked fine. I tried downloading the images and using them locally, the app worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id=&#34;bug&#34;&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 bug?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I found out that the app worked the whole time on phones with Windows 10, only phones with Windows Phone 8.1 were affected. Android and iOS apps that the customer has also never experienced this problem. This make me thing that there is some kind of bug in Windows Phone 8.1 that causes this behavior, because the app does not do any image processing, it only uses an Image control and sets is Source url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample app to reproduce the problem: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/WindowsPhoneHttpsImageBug&#34;&gt;https://github.com/igorkulman/WindowsPhoneHttpsImageBug&lt;/a&gt;. The solution contains a Windows Phone 8 project and a Windows Phone 8.1. Both apps suffer from the sample problem, but the problem is worse in the Silverlight app. This also makes me think that this is a Windows Phone 8.1 bug, independent on the Windows Phone SDK version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a video using the sample app showing the problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed video-player&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://player.vimeo.com/video/138747871&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Microsoft’s Outlook on Android and iOS</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/microsofts-outlook-on-android-and-ios/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/microsofts-outlook-on-android-and-ios/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To those who don’t know, Microsoft launched several months ago Outlook for Android and iOS phones and tablets. Microsoft’s new brand of Outlook have replace the failing “Outlook-branded apps” that are only available to the current subscribers of Office 365. The upheaval comes after Microsoft acquired San Francisco-based company, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acompli.com/&#34;&gt;Acompli.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/Outlook-Best-New-Apps.png&#34; class=&#34;pure-img-width&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acompli is an “advanced email application that empowers professionals to do more with emails, full calendaring, easy file sharing and log all the important people in one email format.” The format supports Microsoft’s Office 365, Gmail and Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s plan is for both the Accompli and the new Outlook app to replace the rather dated Outlook-branded apps. The newfangled Outlook app is primarily based on the technology from the Acompli app that the company acquired for $200 million. Microsoft stated that it was a major factor in buying the app, as its staff could then make up the core group of engineers needed to drive the new Outlook app forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that Microsoft is shifting its focus from PC-installed base as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekwire.com/2014/flurry-report-mobile-phones-162-minutes/&#34;&gt;GeekWire.com&lt;/a&gt; reports that a study showed Americans spend approximately 162 minutes a day on their phones browsing. And with Gaming Realms, the developer behind the entertainment medium &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pocketfruity.com/casino&#34;&gt;PocketFruity.com&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the global smartphone use has now reached 17%, apps are seeing a spike regarding financial investments and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see how well the new Outlook app is received after a year or so. With the app retaining many of the features that its recent acquisition Acompli successfully exhibited, there’s a possibility that the consumer base may just stay with the Acompli until Outlook perfects the new app further, and add features that will set it apart from other leading email applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problems getting paid from the Windows Store, again</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/problems-getting-paid-from-the-windows-store-again/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/problems-getting-paid-from-the-windows-store-again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not make much money on my Windows Phone apps (who does?), but when the payout time comes every couple of months, I expect the money to be delivered. Dealing with Microsoft, I should know better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failed payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I looked into the Dev Center and saw that my scheduled payment failed, telling me to contact the support. So I did. The result was one moth of exchanging email without a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft employee told me that I am in a small group of people with this problem. I do not know if I have such a bad look always be in a problematic supposedly small group, or that the group are not that small. He told me that Microsoft will retry the payment. The payment was supposedly retried on June 24th and succeeded. So they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great news, your June payout was returned due to an internal issue; however, the payout of 5264.17 CZK has been re-attempted and was successfully completed on June 24th. If you have not received the payout then please review this transaction with your bank. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never got the money. The employee asked me a few times if I got the money and then resigned, telling me that it is my problem and I should check with my bank. Of course I checked with my bank, they do not have the money. If they had, they would transfer it to my account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will it happen again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the support is not helpful, I think I will never see this money and I can just hope the next payment in a couple of months will be successful. Will it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a look at my payout settings in the new Dev Center and it is a mess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/payout.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;It previous pages is telling my that everything is ok and my data is valid, but is it? Those four radios do not give me the confidence to believe it. Especially seeing my old account (x3168) that was there in the Windows Store and I deleted it. I used to get the payment to the x0026 account that was in my Windows Phone Store account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing about this form, I never found out how to delete this old account. If you select it, you can only edit it, no way to delete it. If I select the correct account and click save, nothing changes, the radios all remain unselected. I do now know it is a bug or another great Microsoft UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess maybe the next payment will also get lost somewhere ..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Removing unused strings from Windows Phone 8 RESX files</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/removing-unused-strings-from-windows-phone-8-resx-files/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/removing-unused-strings-from-windows-phone-8-resx-files/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using RESX files is the standard approach to Windows Phone 8 app localization, it is even contained in the standard project templates. When you work on a project for a longer time, you may get to a situation that your RESX files contain strings that you no longer use. This is a problem especially when you want to add a new localization, because it is slower and kind of wasteful localizing unused strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem I have created a simple command line utility, that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/RemoveUnusedResources&#34;&gt;available at Github&lt;/a&gt;. This utility assumes that you use the standard localization approach from the templates (AppResources.{lang}.resx and LocalizedStrings.{value} in XAML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage is really simple. Just run the utility with the path to your project as a parameter. It will detect all resources files and remove all the unused strings from them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Customizing the Player Framework UI</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/customizing-the-player-framework-ui/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/customizing-the-player-framework-ui/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last article I gave you a tip on how to localize the Player Framework, in this article I will show you have to customize the UI of the actual player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to obtain the Generic.xaml file that the Player Framework uses for styling. You can find it in C:\ Program Files (x86)\ Microsoft SDKs\ Windows\ v8.0\ ExtensionSDKs\ Microsoft.PlayerFramework.Xaml\ 2.0.0.0\ Redist\ CommonConfiguration\ neutral\ Microsoft.PlayerFramework\ Themes. Copy it to your projects and rename it to something more telling, like PlayerFramework.xaml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now edit the copied XAML file and customize it any way you want. If you do the styling for a Windows Phone app, keep in mind that the ControlPanel switches to the Compact states and a few transformations are applied by default, that can interfere with your styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need to apply the style by adding it to the page with your player&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The death of the WinRT developer?</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/the-death-of-the-winrt-developer/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/the-death-of-the-winrt-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many other Windows Phone / Windows 8 / Universal apps developers (lets just call us WinRT developers) I watched the Build 2015 keynote last night. And I did not like it. I know Microsoft does not know to communicate but the message for me was clear. We, the WinRT developer, are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Microsoft announced that WPF apps will be allowed to be submitted to the Windows Store to be used on desktops / tablets. So why would anyone want to develop (or want to have developed) a Windows 8 (WinRT) app, when they can just use WPF and get everything done easier? I do not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But allowing WPF apps to the Windows Store is a small news compared to the ability to run Android apps on Windows Phone. The first news talked about porting Android apps to the Windows Phone, but later, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-microsoft-hopes-to-get-android-and-ios-phone-apps-into-its-windows-10-store/&#34;&gt;statements like this&lt;/a&gt; appeared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android developers will be able to submit versions of their apps, written in Java or C++, to the Windows Store in he form of APKs and have those apps work on Windows Phone 10 devices. Android developers should be able to start submitting apps to the Windows 10 Store some time in the next few months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let get this straight. Who would want a native mobile Windows app developed, when they can just take their Android app and use it on Windows? What company would want to keep their mobile Windows team, when they can just use their Android team to make Windows apps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; width=&#34;550&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    So I can use WPF to get into the store, and Java to get onto WinPhone and Android. So why would I write a universal app???
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;mdash; Morten Nielsen (@dotMorten) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dotMorten/status/593467368124379137&#34;&gt;April 29, 2015&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Android apps will probably not run on XBOX and HoloLens, but I doubt Microsoft will open the XBOX store for all the developers, more likely only chosen companies will be allowed to publish apps. HoloLens will be used only by a small number of people if this price is not really low (which I doubt it will be), so only a few HoloLens apps will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the situation seems clear, it is the death of the WinRT developer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my recent universal (Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1) project I implemented PlayReady DRM protected smooth streaming movies playback using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://playerframework.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;Player Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This projects seems to be dead, but it is still the best option when implementing any kind of video playback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I had to do was localize it&amp;#8217;s controls, because the app I worked on was in Czech and Slovak, not in English (the only language the Player Framework supports out of the box). Not all the texts an be localized, but the most visible ones like button labels and error messages can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create your own localization, I suggest you create a new RESW file in your project. You can use and existing one, but I prefer to separate the texts for the Player Framework from texts for the rest of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you have to find out the keys for the string you want to localize. You an &lt;a href=&#34;https://playerframework.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#Win8.Xaml.Localize.Win81/en-US/PlayerFramework.resw&#34;&gt;find them in the source code&lt;/a&gt;. You can just copy the content of that RESW file to yours RESW file and localized everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step is to let the PlayerFramework know about your RESW file using&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leveraging ETag caching in Windows Phone and Windows apps</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/leveraging-etag-caching-in-windows-phone-and-windows-apps/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/leveraging-etag-caching-in-windows-phone-and-windows-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous article I showed you &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/using-etag-to-cache-responses-in-nancyfx/&#34; title=&#34;Using ETag to cache responses in NancyFX&#34;&gt;how to implements server side caching using ETag&lt;/a&gt;. HTTP clients on other platforms can usually work with ETag automatically, but of course, the portable HTTP client used on Windows platforms cannot. You have to implement ETag handling yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/tvtime-track-your-favorite-tv-shows-on-windows-phone/&#34; title=&#34;TvTime: track your favorite TV shows on Windows Phone&#34;&gt;TvTime&lt;/a&gt;, all the server requests are GET request, so I remember the ETag values for each Url (= each GET request). I store the ETag values in application local settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the app wants to get some data, I perform a GET request including the ETag as the If-None-Match header. If my ETag matches with the ETag on the server, the server returns HTTP 304 Not Modified and I return the cached data from disk. Otherwise I read the response body and return it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/55fa534bdcb4ab963253.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works with the portable Http client library, that you can use with Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight), 8.1 (Sliverlight), 8.1 XAML and Windows &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.1. If you only need to support Windows Phone 8.1 XAML and Windows 8.1, you may want to look into the Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing the PivotItem header color in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/changing-the-pivotitem-header-color-in-windows-phone-8-1-xaml/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/changing-the-pivotitem-header-color-in-windows-phone-8-1-xaml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 XAML contains a Pivot control that looks like the one from Windows Phone &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and also should behave the same way, but does not. You will find the first problem with the new Pivot when you want to change the PivotItem header color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Phone &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to change the PivotItem header color in Windows Phone &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, you just define the color in the Header template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/a49d0c7d471c4de42521.js?file=wp8.xaml&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works great, changing the color of the active PivotItem Header to the color you want and applying some opacity to the inactive PivotItem Headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/header78.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 XAML&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply the same Header template to PivotItem in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, you will find that there is a bug in the control. The inactive PivotItem Headers do not get opacity change applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/header81.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a problem, if you do not want to do same SelectedIndex manipulation to change the color programatically for all the inactive PivotItem headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is a way to fix this. You can redefine the PivotHeaderForegroundUnselectedBrush and PivotHeaderForegroundSelectedBrush to the active and inactive colors of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/a49d0c7d471c4de42521.js?file=wp81.xaml&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Dialog helper for Universal Apps the easy way</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/dialog-helper-for-universal-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/dialog-helper-for-universal-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I read Joost van Schaik&amp;#8217;s blog post called &lt;a href=&#34;http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.nl/2014/12/a-behavior-to-show-messagedialog-from.html&#34;&gt;A behavior to show a MessageDialog from a MVVMLight viewmodel in Universal apps–with callbacks&lt;/a&gt;. I am not a MVVMLight guy (I use Caliburn.Micro) and I personally use an approach that uses a little less code, employing a helper class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helper class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=DialogHelper.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with a simple usage in ViewModel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=usage.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in the View (making use of Caliburn.Micro mapping the AppBarButton with x:Name=&amp;#8221;Message&amp;#8221; to the Message method in the ViewModel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=usage.xaml&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to show a dialog with just the Ok button, set cancelText to null and do not process the helper method&amp;#8217;s result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not like static classes, just make it service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=DialogHelperService.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the usage in the ViewModel will change just slightly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=usage2.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you can easily mock the service and test the ViewModel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the complete code in a sample solution on GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/SampleMessagePopup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/igorkulman/SampleMessagePopup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a fake splashscreen for your Universal App</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/creating-a-fake-splashscreen-for-your-universal-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/creating-a-fake-splashscreen-for-your-universal-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may want your app to display the startup splashscreen a bit longer, so you can initialize or fetch some data necessary for the app to run. To achieve this, you can create a fake splaschreen, a View that looks just like the splashscreen, does all the work and redirects to the real main View afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, it is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a SplashScreenView with just the right background and the splashscreen image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the app to display SplashScreenView at startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do all the initializing and data fetching in SplashScreenViewModel and redirect to there real MainView&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works quite well with Windows 8.1, but on Windows Phone 8.1 there is a problem. When you run the Windows Phone 8.1 app, you will see a page transition happen between the real splashscreen and your SplashScreenView. This looks strange, so it is better to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the Frame transitions on Windows Phone 8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this issue, you can disable the transitions on the frame and add them manually to each View other than SplashScreenView, but there is a better way. You can disable the transitions when creating the frame and the enable them after navigating from the SplashScreenView. Do not forget the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/&#34; title=&#34;Why Universal Apps as not as universal as you may think&#34;&gt;#ifdefs, because it is one of those many things that are Windows Phone specific in the Universal Apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/d61c0a71e8ed0e2fbc1d.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the illusion of the fake splashscreen perfect, but I would recommend adding a ProgressBar or ProgressRing to the SplashScreenView so the users do not have the feeling that your app froze.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Universal Apps as not as universal as you may think</title>
      <link>http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been developing Windows Phone apps for a few years now, always sticking to Silverlight and keeping using Silverlight also after Microsoft announced the WinRT flavor of Windows Phone apps and the so called Universal Apps. The Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 Silverlight APIs have some limitations, but are now well known do not contain many bugs. They are the safe choice if you want to create a Windows Phone apps. And do not forget that there are still many device running Windows Phone 8 (like Verizon customers in the US) that never got the 8.1 updated promised to everyone during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really universal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 XAML and Universal Apps included WinRT APIs that have many problems, including some that there is no solution for. I used the WinRT APIs when creating first Windows 8 apps about 2 years ago, so I am not new to the APIs. I have not touched the WinRT APIs again until recently, because there was no demand for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 apps. Why would it? People use Windows 8 or 8.1 but do not care about Metro apps, they give them no value compared to &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; Win32 and Windows tablets are practically non-exists (expect for the Surface tablets owned by few programmers and maybe no one else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a client was thinking about adding a Windows Phone app for their service the its existing Android and iOS apps, but they did not think it was worth the money. So the local Microsoft branch told them they would pay for the app (seems like many of the app here are created this way) under two conditions. The app had to be a Universal App and had to be finished before the years end. The client agreed and I had to create a Universal App. And the problems started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, Universal Apps are supposed to make code sharing between Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 simple and allow you to reuse as much code as possible. This works on the trivial Microsoft samples, but try to create a real world app. I have a business logic project with API calls, storage, etc. in a portable class library (like I always did before Universal Apps existed) and I created an Universal App from the template. And the #ifdef hell started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/images/56995992.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#ifdefs everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Universal Apps you can safely share the ViewModels (I am using Caliburn.Micro) .. and that is about it. You have to create separate Views (because on phone and desktop information is typically displayed different), but the worst parts are the #ifdefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to set some properties of the main Frame, you have to use #ifdefs because the frame is a bit different on phone and desktop (like animations). You want to reuse as much DataTemplates as possible, so add another #ifdef for adding the right resource dictionary or many #ifdefs in the data templates to tune them, because it does not matter you use GridView on phone and GridView on desktop, they behave a bit differently in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to add audio playback to your app. There is a background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 and none for Windows 8.1 In Windows 8.1 you need a global MediaElement in your Frame and handling everything differently. So add another big #ifdef. And by the way, the background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 really sucks compared to the old Silverlight APIs. Just try downloading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/BackgroundAudio-63bbc319&#34;&gt;sample form MSDN&lt;/a&gt; and hitting Suspend and Resume in Visual Studio, the background agent crashes horribly, without any exception and takes your Visual Studio instance to hell with it. And of course, the background audio playback API does not work on some phones. &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26175599/windows-phone-8-1-rt-backgroundmediaplayer-not-working&#34;&gt;Just does not work&lt;/a&gt;. I confirmed this finding with other developers. Another messed up API that used to work before the whole Universal Apps hype. And explain this to the client who sees that things like this work on iOS, work on Android, hell, they even for on Windows Phone 8.0 (Slivelight) apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More messed up APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 is messed up, anything else? Sure. BackgroundDownloader is another example. In Silverlight, there was a BackgroundDownloader that was quite limited, but it worked. In Universal Apps, there is a new BackgroundDownloader with some new features, and some essential ones missing. For example, in Silverlight, each download could have a Tag, where you can store any data so you know something about the download when it finishes (to what business entity it belongs, etc.). Not any more in Universal Apps. There is no Tag, so you have to build and manage you own kind of index for all the downloads, so you can actually match them to your business entities. An annoyance, but nothing you cannot manage, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BackgroundDownloader in Universal Apps has a bigger problem. It sometimes crashes so horribly, that it reboots the whole device! No exception, no logs, just a reboot. The maximum limit for the BackgroundDownloader is 1000 downloads, but try adding say 300 to the queue, cancelling them after a few minutes (does not seem to matter if you use one cancellation token or give each download its own) and there is a good chance the phone or the emulator will reboot itself. Not always, but quite often. Again, try explaining this issue to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Silverlight, I commonly used the LongListSelector to display data, using it with a WrapPanel when I needed to create a two column layout. The LongListSelector is gone, in Universal Apps you have to use GridView also on Windows Phone. Or you can use the ListView with a custom wrap panel you write yourself or download somewhere, but it takes some effort to make it do virtualization properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you use GridView on both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 to make it consistent. Add tens f of items with images to it and the performance starts to really suffer. Gray placeholders will show up and more importantly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27488201/gridview-and-placeholders-that-never-disapper-in-windows-8-and-windows-phone-app&#34;&gt;never disappears&lt;/a&gt;. You do not event need images, just add about 300 text only items to the GridView and the gray placeholders will starts to show when scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need another proof that the WinRT controls are slower? Just &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn5hVq6Q-zo&#34;&gt;take a look at this video comparing the media app on and old Windows Phone 7 to the media app on a much more powerful device running Windows Phone 8.1&lt;/a&gt;. You can see that the old, single core device runs the Silverlight apps faster than the new powerful phone runs the new WinRT equivalent of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
