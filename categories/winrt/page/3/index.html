                        <p>I recently discovered two really neet tools that helped me with Windows Store app development.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Store Icon Maker</strong></p>

<p>When creating a Windows Store or Windows 8 apps, there are many icon sizes you have to provide. If you do nont wat to do all the resizing by yourself, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/DavidBurela/WindowsMarketplaceIconMaker">Windows Store Icon Maker</a>. It is a fork of the <a href="http://wpiconmaker.codeplex.com/">Windows Phone Icons Maker</a> with added support for Windows Store apps. It takes a 300x300px icon as input and outputs all the square icons you need.</p>

<p><strong>HAMMER.Pants</strong></p>

<p>To brand Windows Store apps written in XAML, you need to override all the control styles. This sucks if you just want to change the colours to match your theme. <a href="https://github.com/Code52/HAMMER">HAMMER.Pants</a> solves this, by auto-modifying all the coloured brushes so you don&#8217;t have to pick through them. Currently, you provide a &#8220;base&#8221; colour, and HAMMER.Pants modifies that based on the luminance variation found in the original styles. That is, if you pick red, all the purples will be replaced with reds, but they&#8217;ll change in brightness slightly just like the default purples do.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Displaying PDF files in a mobile apps is a valid use case and there are many iOS and Android app that do it. WinRT has no APIs for displaying PDF files. The only thing you can do with a PDF in WinRT is to display it in the default PDF viewer app using the Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync method. This is typicaly not what you want to do. This method takes the user out of your app and more importantly the PDF can be copied, shared, etc.</p>

<p>There are a few 3rd party components for displaying PDF files in Windows Store apps, each has some problems and restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>ComponentOne PDFViewer</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.componentone.com">ComponentOne</a> has a <a href="http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/PdfViewerWinRT/">PDFViewer component</a> as part of their <a href="http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/StudioWinRTXAML/">Studio for WinRT XAML</a> package. This package costs $895. There are <a href="http://helpcentral.componentone.com/nethelp/PdfViewerWinRT/#!Documents/pdfviewerlimitations1.htm">many limitations</a> when using this component that you need to be aware of. If you want to have more control over the rendered PDF files, you can get all the pages as FrameworkElements and do not need to use the PDFViewer as one monolitic component. It does not support all the fonts and complex documents are rendered really messed up, it was not usable for me at all.</p>

<p><strong>Foxit Embedded PDF SDK</strong></p>

<p>Foxit has a <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/sdk/embedded/winrt/">Embedded PDF SDK for Windows RT</a> and <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/sdk/embedded/win8/">Embedded PDF SDK for Windows Store Apps</a> (what is the difference?). If you want to try it, you have to fill in a registration form. There is no information about pricing and you need to fill in another form to ask for a quotation. You can get the pages of the PDF files as images if you want more control, but the component only works with StorageFiles. It cannot open a custom stream (e.g: file in isolated storage with custom encryption).</p>

<p><strong>TallComponents PDFRasterizer</strong></p>

<p>TallComponents has a PDFRasterizer component that is currently in beta. You need to <a href="https://www.tallcomponents.com/betaprogram.aspx">join the beta program</a> to get access. The final version should be out in 6-8 weeks. PDFRasterizer costs 1490€ for a single app. It is just a rasterizer, you can get the pages of the PDF files as images and that is all. It works well with differents fonts and complex documents.</p>

<p><strong>PDFTron Mobile PDF SDK</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pdftron.com/index.html">PDFTron</a> has a <a href="http://www.pdftron.com/pdfnet/mobile/windows8_winrt_pdf_library.html">Mobile PDF SDK</a> that works with Windows Store apps. To get a trial version you have to fill in a form where you have to describe your app. The pricing is not clear, it dependes on many factors and you need to write them an email to get a price. You can get pages from the PDF file but not in a usable format like an image.</p>

<p>So which PDF solution should you use? That dependes on your needs. I am afraid you will have to check each of them out by yourself and assess it according to your needs.</p>

                        <p>Windows 8 development has <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/why-are-there-no-great-windows-8-apps-because-of-winrt-a-developers-view/">many problems and pitfalls because of WinRT</a>. Windows Store, the only distribution channel for Windows 8 apps, has some problems too. One of them is really serious for everyone who wants to create a newspaper or newsreader app with in-app purchases.</p>

<p>We developed a Windows 8 app for a local newspaper. The content consists of issues, there is one issue published each work day. The users can buy the issues using in-app purchases. The problem is that there is a limit of <del datetime="2013-05-26T14:03:17+00:00">100</del> 200 in-app purchases that can be defined for a single app in Windows Store. I really do not know what would Microsoft impose such a limit.</p>

<p>As far as I know there is no way around the limit. We need to either delete in-app purchases for old issues so user will no longer be able to buy them (which is stupid and as ot turns out not possible) or create new app with a different name and in-app purchases for another time period (which is even more stupid).</p>

<p>Sure you can implement content purchasing using other ways, but they all have one big problem. There is no way your app can get the identity of the user. If you implement your own purchasing mechanism, you cannot pair the purchases with the user, only with the device. So the user would have to buy the same content on each device, if he reinstall his system, etc. That is usually not what you want.</p>

                        <p>I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified.

                        <p>Let&#8217;s face it, there are no really great apps for Windows 8 and the number of trashy apps is also very low compared to the Android and iOS ecosystems. Microsoft looks really desperate to bring more apps and developers to the ecosystem. Instead of improving the API and its capabilities, Microsoft just generates <a href="http://build.windowsstore.com/keepthecash">desperately looking campaigns to improve the apps count</a>. I sometimes wonder if they ever realize that the number of apps is not important when people cannot find the apps they are used to use on Android or iOS in the Windows Store.</p>

<p><img src="/images/microsoft-surface-2-650x0.jpg" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>So why are there so few Windows 8 apps? I will tell you my (and only my) opinion and experience. I developed a few Windows 8 apps, some of them fairly complex. I tried to develop a few really great apps but many of those projects never got done. The reason is the API (WinRT).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with something (that should be) trivial. Imagine you want to <strong>display HTML files with images, CSS, JS in a WebView</strong>. It is a common scenario for displaying downloaded manuals, interactive texts, etc. It can be done on Android, iOS and even on Windows Phone by copying the data to isolated storage and pointing the WebView there.</p>

<p>This scenario is impossible in WinRT. You can reference files in Isolated Storage (Local / Roaming folders) using the ms-appdata protocol, but the WebView does not work with it. You can use the NavigateToString method to display one HTML file, but all the images, CSS, JS references must be internet URLs, you cannot reference other local files. The only way around this issue is to inline all the CSS, JS and images (as base64) to the HTML file. Really messy, painful and slow and not really an option if you have JS reading XML files and inserting external images.</p>

<p><del datetime="2013-03-21T17:08:20+00:00">There is another workaround pointed out by Javier Sosa in the comments. Instead of saving your files to Local / Roaming folders, save them to the installation folder of your app (Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation) and use the ms-appx-web protocol. The WebView can for some reason work with ms-appx-web but not with ms-appdata. Saving your data to the installation folder instead of data folders is quite messy in my opinion. Another problem is, that you cannot create folders in Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation. This means you have to preprocess your HTML,CSS,JS files and make the file structure flat.</del> Turns out this works only in debug, so it is not a viable workaround.</p>

<p>Let us continue with something as basic and common as Zip files. Windows 8 offers absolutely <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/tampering-with-windows-store-apps-data/">no protection of your locally saved files</a> so a client may want to at least use password protected Zip files. <strong>The ZipArchive class in WinRT does not support password protected Zip files</strong>. No 3rd party Zip library can be compiled in WinRT because of a missing Security namespace. You are out of luck, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15367922/ziparchive-with-password-in-windows-store-apps">there is no workaround</a> and it may be a deal-breaker for a security-conscious client.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress">SharpCompress</a> now supports WinRT! Get <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/sharpcompress/">version 0.9+ from Nuget</a>.</p>

<p>Let us assume that you want to create an interactive textbook app like there are a few on iOS. The apps should contain <strong>multimedia content like images, video, sounds, Word and Excel documents</strong>. You would assume that displaying (or better said previewing) Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel files on a Microsoft platform would be easy. You should have learned to limit your expectations and always assume the worst by now when dealing with WinRT. You can <a href="https://www.syncfusion.com/products/winrt">display Word documents with a component for $199</a> and <a href="https://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/SpreadWinRT/">Excel sheets with one for $1195</a>. Previewing Microsoft Office documents on iOS is easy and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/QuickLook/Reference/QuickLookFrameworkReference_iPhoneOS/_index.html">built-in</a>.</p>

<p>Do you need your app to <strong>display PDF files</strong>? There are a few solutions, mainly in beta and each has some flaws. I will write a <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/displaying-pdf-files-in-windows-store-apps/">separate article about rendering PDF files in WinRT</a> but, again, be prepared to spend at least $900 for something that can be done for free on other platforms. Sure, you can send the PDF file to the default PDF viewer but that is usually not what you want. It takes the user out of your app and more importantly you cannot protected the PDF content from copying, sharing, etc.</p>

<p>Do not forget about the <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/few-thoughts-about-the-windows-phone-store-certification-process/">strange behavior of the Windows Store certification process</a> and the bugs.</p>

<p>I am really fed up with telling customers who want an (complex iOS clone) app the magic words &#8220;it is not possible in Windows 8&#8221;.</p>

                        <p>When navigating in a Windows Store app, you can specify a navigation parameter. This navigation parameter can be any object but there is a problem. When the application is suspended, this navigation parameter is saved by the LayoutAwarePage. This works only with primitive data types, unless you change the implementation of the class which instances you pass as the navigation parameter.</p>

<p>I use mainly ints (article id, gallery id &#8230;) as navigation parameters but sometimes just on int is not enough. If I want to pass two int parameters, I &#8220;encode&#8221; them into an int and then &#8220;decode&#8221; back on the target page. I have a simple Utils class for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>There is no AutoCompleteBox control that can be used when building Windows Store apps in C# and XAML so I decided to create one, because I needed it for a project. Currently it supports only String collections and the selected value must be accessed using code behind, but this will hopefully change.</p>

<p>The AutoCompleteBox uses <a href="http://winrtxamltoolkit.codeplex.com/">WinRT XAML Toolkit</a> to show the watermark and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Reactive Extensions</a> so the users does not need to press enter, the results will show after they stop typing for a second.</p>

<p>The project is hosted on my Bitbucket so you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox">https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox</a>, forks and code contributions are welcomed. Nuget package is available at <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT">https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT</a>.</p>

<p>Installation using Nuget:</p>

<pre><code>Install-Package AutoCompleteBoxWinRT
</code></pre>

                        <p>XAML supports stating color definitions as hexa strings (starting with #) but there is no built-in way to do it in C#, you must write your own method to do it, that might look like this</p>

                        <p>When I had to create a library to generate UI elements with animated image Ads I found out that creating complicated UI elements in code with bindings is not as easy as doing the same in XAML. A better way is to create your UI elements and bindings in a XAML file (if they are not very dynamic of course), load the XAML at runtime, parse it and set its DataContext.</p>

<p>First you need to read the XAML file. You can use the standard API with Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation as the folder. The XAML file must be set to Build=Content in your project</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849482.js"></script></p>

<p>Once you have the XAML read as string, you can use the XamlReader and cast it to a DependencyObject.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849490.js"></script></p>

<p>or a more concrete class like UserControl if you know what the file contains.</p>

                        <p>If you ever generated a MD5 or SHA hash in C# you problaby uset the classes from the System.Security.Cryptography namespace. This namespace is not available in WinRT, you have to use the Windows.Security.Cryptography.Core instead. This namespace contians a class called HashAlgorithmProvider that can be used to generate hashes using MD5 and SHA (SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512). A simple method to generate a hash for a string using a given algorithm may look like this</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849454.js"></script></p>

<p>Specifing the algoritm by its string name is not a good idea in my opinion, although you can use the names from the HashAlgorithmNames class. I would rather make the GetHash method private and create public method for all the algorithms</p>
