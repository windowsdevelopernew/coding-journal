                        <p>In my current project I had to implement an interesting feature for both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 project of the Universal app. The idea is simply. The users want to search for a movie. They enter a search term into a TextBox and a list of results is shown. The results should have the search term highlighted in them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/highlighting.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The standard TextBlock used to display the movie titles does not support any kind of letter highlighting, so I had to write a custom one. I created a custom UserControl. The UserControl contains a few dependency properties Text, HighlightedText, HighlightBrush and a TextBlock. When Text or HighlightedText change, the Text is then split into multiple Runs that are added to the TextBlock.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/87b051f2f3a54bf895f0.js"></script></p>

<p>The whole working custom control is available at Github: <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WPA81.HighlightTextBox">https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WPA81.HighlightTextBox</a>.</p>

                        <p>I do not make much money on my Windows Phone apps (who does?), but when the payout time comes every couple of months, I expect the money to be delivered. Dealing with Microsoft, I should know better.</p>

<p><strong>Failed payment</strong></p>

<p>Last month I looked into the Dev Center and saw that my scheduled payment failed, telling me to contact the support. So I did. The result was one moth of exchanging email without a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with support</strong></p>

<p>The Microsoft employee told me that I am in a small group of people with this problem. I do not know if I have such a bad look always be in a problematic supposedly small group, or that the group are not that small. He told me that Microsoft will retry the payment. The payment was supposedly retried on June 24th and succeeded. So they say.</p>

<p><em>Great news, your June payout was returned due to an internal issue; however, the payout of 5264.17 CZK has been re-attempted and was successfully completed on June 24th. If you have not received the payout then please review this transaction with your bank. Please let me know if you have any further questions.</em></p>

<p>I never got the money. The employee asked me a few times if I got the money and then resigned, telling me that it is my problem and I should check with my bank. Of course I checked with my bank, they do not have the money. If they had, they would transfer it to my account.</p>

<p><strong>Will it happen again?</strong></p>

<p>So the support is not helpful, I think I will never see this money and I can just hope the next payment in a couple of months will be successful. Will it?</p>

<p>I took a look at my payout settings in the new Dev Center and it is a mess</p>

<p><img src="/images/payout.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>It previous pages is telling my that everything is ok and my data is valid, but is it? Those four radios do not give me the confidence to believe it. Especially seeing my old account (x3168) that was there in the Windows Store and I deleted it. I used to get the payment to the x0026 account that was in my Windows Phone Store account.</p>

<p>Funny thing about this form, I never found out how to delete this old account. If you select it, you can only edit it, no way to delete it. If I select the correct account and click save, nothing changes, the radios all remain unselected. I do now know it is a bug or another great Microsoft UI.</p>

<p>So I guess maybe the next payment will also get lost somewhere ..</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>In a recent project I had to implement Google login to an Universal App. I decided to use the native <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows.security.authentication.web.webauthenticationbroker.aspx">WebAuthenticationBroker</a> control and the implementation was not as straightforward as I hoped. By implementing Google login I mean getting the authentication token that you can then use with your server API.</p>

<p>WebAuthenticationBroker is a good idea but it is implemented rather poorly. It works differently on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 due to the &#8220;AndContinue&#8221; pattern that Windows Phone 8.1 forces on you. You can solve this with <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/">some ifdefs and platform specific code, as always</a>.</p>

<p>The real problem s that the <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Web-Authentication-d0485122">MSDN sample</a> states it works with Google login but it does not. The sample thinks it gets the authentication token but it does not, it just gets the success code that you have to exchange for the authentication token yourself.</p>

<p>Lets start with a basic config</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/65a406f7f3cff48be3c5.js?file=config.cs"></script>

<p>The important things here are your Google app id and Google app secret. The GoogleStartUri also contains permissions that you want to get (profile, <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login</a> and <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me</a> email in my case).</p>

<p>You use this config with a WebAuthenticationBroker call</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/65a406f7f3cff48be3c5.js?file=login.cs"></script>

<p>on Windows 8.1 you get the response data immediately. On Windows Phone 8.1, you have to implement the &#8220;AndContinue&#8221; pattern.</p>

<p>You use the response data to parse out the success code</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/65a406f7f3cff48be3c5.js?file=GetGoogleSuccessCode.cs"></script>

<p>Now that you have the success code, you can exchange it for the authentication token</p>

<p>And now you finally have a way to get the authentication token and implement Google login.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/65a406f7f3cff48be3c5.js?file=GetToken.cs"></script>

                        <p>In my last article I gave you a tip on how to localize the Player Framework, in this article I will show you have to customize the UI of the actual player.</p>

<p>The first step is to obtain the Generic.xaml file that the Player Framework uses for styling. You can find it in C:\ Program Files (x86)\ Microsoft SDKs\ Windows\ v8.0\ ExtensionSDKs\ Microsoft.PlayerFramework.Xaml\ 2.0.0.0\ Redist\ CommonConfiguration\ neutral\ Microsoft.PlayerFramework\ Themes. Copy it to your projects and rename it to something more telling, like PlayerFramework.xaml.</p>

<p>You can now edit the copied XAML file and customize it any way you want. If you do the styling for a Windows Phone app, keep in mind that the ControlPanel switches to the Compact states and a few transformations are applied by default, that can interfere with your styling.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to apply the style by adding it to the page with your player</p>

                        <p>As many other Windows Phone / Windows 8 / Universal apps developers (lets just call us WinRT developers) I watched the Build 2015 keynote last night. And I did not like it. I know Microsoft does not know to communicate but the message for me was clear. We, the WinRT developer, are no longer needed.</p>

<p>First, Microsoft announced that WPF apps will be allowed to be submitted to the Windows Store to be used on desktops / tablets. So why would anyone want to develop (or want to have developed) a Windows 8 (WinRT) app, when they can just use WPF and get everything done easier? I do not know.</p>

<p>But allowing WPF apps to the Windows Store is a small news compared to the ability to run Android apps on Windows Phone. The first news talked about porting Android apps to the Windows Phone, but later, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-microsoft-hopes-to-get-android-and-ios-phone-apps-into-its-windows-10-store/">statements like this</a> appeared</p>

<p><em>Android developers will be able to submit versions of their apps, written in Java or C++, to the Windows Store in he form of APKs and have those apps work on Windows Phone 10 devices. Android developers should be able to start submitting apps to the Windows 10 Store some time in the next few months.</em></p>

<p>So let get this straight. Who would want a native mobile Windows app developed, when they can just take their Android app and use it on Windows? What company would want to keep their mobile Windows team, when they can just use their Android team to make Windows apps?</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">

    So I can use WPF to get into the store, and Java to get onto WinPhone and Android. So why would I write a universal app???

<p>Sure, Android apps will probably not run on XBOX and HoloLens, but I doubt Microsoft will open the XBOX store for all the developers, more likely only chosen companies will be allowed to publish apps. HoloLens will be used only by a small number of people if this price is not really low (which I doubt it will be), so only a few HoloLens apps will be needed.</p>

<p>For me, the situation seems clear, it is the death of the WinRT developer.</p>

                        <p>In my recent universal (Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1) project I implemented PlayReady DRM protected smooth streaming movies playback using the <a href="https://playerframework.codeplex.com/">Player Framework</a>. This projects seems to be dead, but it is still the best option when implementing any kind of video playback.</p>

<p>One of the first things I had to do was localize it&#8217;s controls, because the app I worked on was in Czech and Slovak, not in English (the only language the Player Framework supports out of the box). Not all the texts an be localized, but the most visible ones like button labels and error messages can.</p>

<p>To create your own localization, I suggest you create a new RESW file in your project. You can use and existing one, but I prefer to separate the texts for the Player Framework from texts for the rest of the app.</p>

<p>Next you have to find out the keys for the string you want to localize. You an <a href="https://playerframework.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#Win8.Xaml.Localize.Win81/en-US/PlayerFramework.resw">find them in the source code</a>. You can just copy the content of that RESW file to yours RESW file and localized everything.</p>

<p>The last step is to let the PlayerFramework know about your RESW file using</p>

                        <p>In my previous article I showed you <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/using-etag-to-cache-responses-in-nancyfx/" title="Using ETag to cache responses in NancyFX">how to implements server side caching using ETag</a>. HTTP clients on other platforms can usually work with ETag automatically, but of course, the portable HTTP client used on Windows platforms cannot. You have to implement ETag handling yourself.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/tvtime-track-your-favorite-tv-shows-on-windows-phone/" title="TvTime: track your favorite TV shows on Windows Phone">TvTime</a>, all the server requests are GET request, so I remember the ETag values for each Url (= each GET request). I store the ETag values in application local settings.</p>

<p>When the app wants to get some data, I perform a GET request including the ETag as the If-None-Match header. If my ETag matches with the ETag on the server, the server returns HTTP 304 Not Modified and I return the cached data from disk. Otherwise I read the response body and return it.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/55fa534bdcb4ab963253.js"></script></p>

<p>This approach works with the portable Http client library, that you can use with Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight), 8.1 (Sliverlight), 8.1 XAML and Windows <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.1. If you only need to support Windows Phone 8.1 XAML and Windows 8.1, you may want to look into the Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient.</p>

                        <p>I am not a mouse or a touch person, I like using the keyboard and keyboard shortcuts for everything. So when I (have to) use a Windows 8.1 Metro app, I always miss when the app does not navigate back when I press the Backspace key, just like the browser does.</p>

<p>Implementing this functionality is really simple, you just need to handle the KeyUp event and listen for the Backspace key. You can implement the KeyUp event handler on every View in your app, but that is not necessary. You can just hook up the global Window.Current.CoreWindow.KeyUp event after you app starts.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/b0f41a1a25acad0d17a4.js"></script></p>

<p>If you implement this in your app, I am sure you will make some of your users more happy.</p>

                        <p>Today I read Joost van Schaik&#8217;s blog post called <a href="http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.nl/2014/12/a-behavior-to-show-messagedialog-from.html">A behavior to show a MessageDialog from a MVVMLight viewmodel in Universal apps–with callbacks</a>. I am not a MVVMLight guy (I use Caliburn.Micro) and I personally use an approach that uses a little less code, employing a helper class.</p>

<p><strong>Helper class</strong></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=DialogHelper.cs"></script>

<p>with a simple usage in ViewModel</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=usage.cs"></script>

<p>and in the View (making use of Caliburn.Micro mapping the AppBarButton with x:Name=&#8221;Message&#8221; to the Message method in the ViewModel</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=usage.xaml"></script>

<p>If you want to show a dialog with just the Ok button, set cancelText to null and do not process the helper method&#8217;s result.</p>

<p><strong>Simple service</strong></p>

<p>If you do not like static classes, just make it service</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=DialogHelperService.cs"></script>

<p>the usage in the ViewModel will change just slightly</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/fda1860b35d5312e9157.js?file=usage2.cs"></script>

<p>and you can easily mock the service and test the ViewModel.</p>

<p>You can find the complete code in a sample solution on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/SampleMessagePopup">https://github.com/igorkulman/SampleMessagePopup</a>.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes you may want your app to display the startup splashscreen a bit longer, so you can initialize or fetch some data necessary for the app to run. To achieve this, you can create a fake splaschreen, a View that looks just like the splashscreen, does all the work and redirects to the real main View afterwards.</p>

<p>In theory, it is quite simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a SplashScreenView with just the right background and the splashscreen image</li>
<li>Set the app to display SplashScreenView at startup</li>
<li>Do all the initializing and data fetching in SplashScreenViewModel and redirect to there real MainView</li>
</ul>

<p>This works quite well with Windows 8.1, but on Windows Phone 8.1 there is a problem. When you run the Windows Phone 8.1 app, you will see a page transition happen between the real splashscreen and your SplashScreenView. This looks strange, so it is better to get rid of it.</p>

<p><strong>Managing the Frame transitions on Windows Phone 8.1</strong></p>

<p>To fix this issue, you can disable the transitions on the frame and add them manually to each View other than SplashScreenView, but there is a better way. You can disable the transitions when creating the frame and the enable them after navigating from the SplashScreenView. Do not forget the <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/" title="Why Universal Apps as not as universal as you may think">#ifdefs, because it is one of those many things that are Windows Phone specific in the Universal Apps</a>.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/d61c0a71e8ed0e2fbc1d.js"></script></p>

<p>This makes the illusion of the fake splashscreen perfect, but I would recommend adding a ProgressBar or ProgressRing to the SplashScreenView so the users do not have the feeling that your app froze.</p>
