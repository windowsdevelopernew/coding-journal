                        <p>I currently work on a Windows Phone 8.1 app for a client with an interesting approach to app localization. They have a Google Docs sheet with all the localization string for the app in all the supported languages and a tool that converts this localization strings in to per-language versioned JSON files. The generated JSON files are kept in a git repository. The Android, iOS and now my Windows Phone app should have the git repository added as a submodule. When a new version of the JSON files with the localization appear in the submodule, the app should use them.</p>

<p><strong>Deciding the localization approach</strong></p>

<p>In the old days of Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 I would simply write an utility that reads the newest version of the JSON localization files and generate a RESX file for each language. RESX is XML format that is simple to generate. If you had a localized string with a key say Game, you would put it everywhere when the localization of the word game was needed. Simple</p>

<p>In Windows Phone 8.1 (and 10) you should use RESW files for localization. This is the new x:Uid approach that, in my honest opinion, really sucks. It forces you to duplicate string if you use I string in multiple places, there is no design time support, you never know what UI element are localized and what you forgot to localize. Simply put, it is a mess. This approach is not usable at all with the string client provides.</p>

<p>There is no way to make any script generate a RESW file with duplicated string matching the multiple usages of each string. If you have a localized string with a key Game and 2 TextBlocks and 1 Buttons that use it, you need to put it into the RESW file 3 times, once for each UI element. SO instead of a Game key, you would have a GameTextBlock.Text key, an AnotherGameTextBlock.Text and a GameButton.Content key, all with the same value and applied in design time. Madness.</p>

<p><strong>Using RESX files on Windows Phone 8.1</strong></p>

<p>One approach to solve this problem is to use the good old RESX files with your Windows Phone 8.1 project. Typically by creating a Portable Class Library (PCL) with the RESX files, doing a bit of configuration for the supported languages and linking this PCL project to your Windows Phone 8.1 project. You can find a few articles about this approach online and also a few gotchas and their solutions. It sounds like a good idea at first, but it is too problematic for my tastes.</p>

<p>I tried this approach but ended frustrated with too many problems too solve, like Visual Studio hanging when deploying to a device when using RESX files. So I decided to go with a custom solution.</p>

<p><strong>Generating Windows Phone 8-like localization strings</strong></p>

<p>Finally I decided to generate a class that would look and behave similar to the old Windows Phone 8-like localization strings class. The idea is quite simple, no need to a PCL or any RESX files.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a directory and empty RESW files for each supported language in the Windows Phone 8.1 project</p>

<img src="/images/languages.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>Then write a script that generates all the RESW files from the newest JSON localization files</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=localization-converter-1.cs"></script>

<p>Now with the RESW files populated with all the localization string it is time to put them to use. First I created a <code>LocalizedStrings</code> class very similar to the one in Windows Phone 8:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=LocalizedStrings.cs"></script>

<p>and added it to <code>App.xaml</code> as a dictionary resources called <code>S</code></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=App.xaml"></script>

<p>The interesting ans still missing part is the <code>AppResources</code> class referenced in <code>LocalizedStrings</code>. It is a partial class, consisting of <code>ResourceLoader</code> instance to get the string at runtime and a Singleton to get the string from C# code</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=AppResources.cs"></script>

<p>The second part of this class is generated by the same script that generates the RESW files. For each key in the localization string, it generates a property like this in the <code>AppResources</code> class</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=AppResources.strings.cs"></script>

<p>The code to generate this is part of the script</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=localization-converter-2.cs"></script>

<p><strong>The result</strong></p>

<p>When you put all this pieces together, you have a RESW files with all the localization strings and a localization class that can be generated on demand. I run the script and generate the files every time there is an update in the git submodule with the JSON localization files.</p>

<p>When I want to use any of these localization string in XAML, I simply use it like this</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=xaml-usage.xaml"></script>

<p>Using a binding allows me to use to use the same localization keys for many elements and I do not have to duplicate the keys like in the x:Uid scenario.</p>

<p>If I need to used a localization string in C#, I have a strongly typed access to it</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/53a29b6e2143cac1ec8a.js?file=csharp-usage.cs"></script>

<p>instead of creating a <code>ResourceLoader</code> instance and calling <code>GetString</code> with a string parameter.</p>

<p>Another approach would be having a public property with the <code>AppResources</code> instance in a <code>ViewModel</code> base class, it would make the binding shorter.</p>
