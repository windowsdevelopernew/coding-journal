                       If you develop Windows Phone, Windows 8, Silverlight or WPF apps using the MVVM pattern, you are familiar with the INotifyPropertyChanged interface. Typical implementation In a typical implementation, you usually have a base class implementing the interface, like or use a framework like MVVMLight, Prism or Caliburn Micro that provides such base class for you. In your view models you have properties using the PropertyChanged method You do not need to create such properties by hand, you can use a snippet, but it is still a lot of code to do such a simple thing.

                       When I released version 2.0 of my app Photo Timeline, some users reported updating problems. I finally found out what caused the problem and submited a new build to the Windows Phone store. In my app I had three localizations: en-US (default), en and cs. I do not exactly remember why I had English twice as localization. I decided to remove the en localization thinking that nothing will break and that was a mistake.

                       I have been a Windows Phone developer for over a year now and my paid apps made me some money. The small amount of money made is not interesting, more interesting is that getting the money from Microsoft has been a real pain. Maybe because I live outside the US, maybe it is a geographically independent problem. If you are a developer and live outside the US, I really want to hear your experience.

                       I recently discovered two really neet tools that helped me with Windows Store app development. Windows Store Icon Maker When creating a Windows Store or Windows 8 apps, there are many icon sizes you have to provide. If you do nont wat to do all the resizing by yourself, you can use the Windows Store Icon Maker. It is a fork of the Windows Phone Icons Maker with added support for Windows Store apps.

                       If you create a Windows Phone app and you want it to be able to run on both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, you target Windows Phone 7 and the app runs on Windows Phone 8 automatically. But is it really enough to create a Windows Phone 7 buíld? Not if you want to create a really well designed app. The problem with Windows Phone 8 from a designers point of view is that it introduces two new display resolutions.

                       Displaying PDF files in a mobile apps is a valid use case and there are many iOS and Android app that do it. WinRT has no APIs for displaying PDF files. The only thing you can do with a PDF in WinRT is to display it in the default PDF viewer app using the Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync method. This is typicaly not what you want to do. This method takes the user out of your app and more importantly the PDF can be copied, shared, etc.

                       I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget. Windows Phone Code: https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP7 Nuget: https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP7/ Windows 8 Code: https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WinRT Nuget: https://nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WinRT My Windows 8 mini-library is best used with the WinRTXAMLToolkit that I contributed to once ot twice.

                       Let&#8217;s face it, there are no really great apps for Windows 8 and the number of trashy apps is also very low compared to the Android and iOS ecosystems. Microsoft looks really desperate to bring more apps and developers to the ecosystem. Instead of improving the API and its capabilities, Microsoft just generates desperately looking campaigns to improve the apps count. I sometimes wonder if they ever realize that the number of apps is not important when people cannot find the apps they are used to use on Android or iOS in the Windows Store.

                       Uploading a file in ASP.NET MVC is very easy, but there is no easy way to detect the encoding of a uploaded text file. However you can use the fact if you try to read the file with a wrong encoding, you get an DecoderFallbackException. So how do you put everything together? First, get a stream of the uploaded file. Next, read the whole file to a byte array Finally

                       While reading an article that had nothing in common with programming I came upon a sudden need to find a way to generate all the permutations of a list, or more exactly a string (it is just a list of characters). As lazy as I am I tried to google a few examples of C# code that does exactly that. I was horrified that programmers could come up with the complicated ways I found.
