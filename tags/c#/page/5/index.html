                       <p>If you develop Windows Phone, Windows 8, Silverlight or WPF apps using the MVVM pattern, you are familiar with the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.</p>

<p><strong>Typical implementation</strong></p>

<p>In a typical implementation, you usually have a base class implementing the interface, like</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5849361.js"></script>

<p>or use a framework like MVVMLight, Prism or Caliburn Micro that provides such base class for you. In your view models you have properties using the PropertyChanged method</p>

                       <p>When I released version 2.0 of my app [Photo Timeline][1], some users reported updating problems. I finally found out what caused the problem and submited a new build to the Windows Phone store.</p>

<p>In my app I had three localizations: en-US (default), en and cs. I do not exactly remember why I had English twice as localization. I decided to remove the en localization thinking that nothing will break and that was a mistake.</p>

<p><strong>Once you add a localization to your app, never remove it!</strong> If you do so, all the users who use your app with that localization will have update problems.</p>

                       <p>I have been a Windows Phone developer for over a year now and my paid apps made me some money. The small amount of money made is not interesting, more interesting is that getting the money from Microsoft has been a real pain. Maybe because I live <strong>outside the US</strong>, maybe it is a geographically independent problem. If you are a developer and live outside the US, I really want to hear your experience.</p>

<p><strong>No exact info about payment rules?</strong></p>

<p>First, there is no exact information about how often a developer gets paid. The [getting paid section][1] in the Windows Phone Dev Center only informs you about tax and bank info, that you need to provide to get paid. I remember that I once heard that developers get paid when their earnings get pass $200, but I was not able to get any official info about this. The first payment I got from Windows Phone Store was $52.50 and I know a developer with $900 earned and no money sent to him, so I guess the $200 limit is not true.</p>

<p>The [$200 limit should be true for Windows Store][2], but Windows Phone Store is a different store with different rules.</p>

                       <p>I recently discovered two really neet tools that helped me with Windows Store app development.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Store Icon Maker</strong></p>

<p>When creating a Windows Store or Windows 8 apps, there are many icon sizes you have to provide. If you do nont wat to do all the resizing by yourself, you can use the [Windows Store Icon Maker][1]. It is a fork of the [Windows Phone Icons Maker][2] with added support for Windows Store apps. It takes a 300x300px icon as input and outputs all the square icons you need.</p>

                       <p>If you create a Windows Phone app and you want it to be able to run on both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, you target Windows Phone 7 and the app runs on Windows Phone 8 automatically. But is it really enough to create a Windows Phone 7 buíld? Not if you want to create a really well designed app.</p>

<p>The problem with Windows Phone 8 from a designers point of view is that it introduces two new display resolutions. Windows Phone 7 supports just one resolution, WVGA of 800x480px. Windows Phone 8 adds WXGA (1280&#215;768) and 720p (1280&#215;720). If you run your Windows Phone 7 app on a WXGA device, the app is proportionally scaled by a factor of 1.6 to fill out the whole screen. As long as you provide all your images scaled by the same factor, the app looks ok.</p>

<p>The problem is 720p, because it is a different aspect ratio (16:9 vs 15:9). Your Windows Phone 7 app running on a 720p app is first scaled by a factor of 1.5 to 1200&#215;720 and the rest of the display (80px) is padded on top or bottom, depending on the VerticalAlignment. By default, the padding is added to the top of your app making your header 80px higher:</p>

                       <p>Displaying PDF files in a mobile apps is a valid use case and there are many iOS and Android app that do it. WinRT has no APIs for displaying PDF files. The only thing you can do with a PDF in WinRT is to display it in the default PDF viewer app using the Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync method. This is typicaly not what you want to do. This method takes the user out of your app and more importantly the PDF can be copied, shared, etc.</p>

<p>There are a few 3rd party components for displaying PDF files in Windows Store apps, each has some problems and restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>ComponentOne PDFViewer</strong></p>

<p>[ComponentOne][1] has a [PDFViewer component][2] as part of their [Studio for WinRT XAML][3] package. This package costs $895. There are [many limitations][4] when using this component that you need to be aware of. If you want to have more control over the rendered PDF files, you can get all the pages as FrameworkElements and do not need to use the PDFViewer as one monolitic component. It does not support all the fonts and complex documents are rendered really messed up, it was not usable for me at all.</p>

I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified.

                       <p>Let&#8217;s face it, there are no really great apps for Windows 8 and the number of trashy apps is also very low compared to the Android and iOS ecosystems. Microsoft looks really desperate to bring more apps and developers to the ecosystem. Instead of improving the API and its capabilities, Microsoft just generates [desperately looking campaigns to improve the apps count][1]. I sometimes wonder if they ever realize that the number of apps is not important when people cannot find the apps they are used to use on Android or iOS in the Windows Store.</p>

<img src="/images/microsoft-surface-2-650x0.jpg" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>So why are there so few Windows 8 apps? I will tell you my (and only my) opinion and experience. I developed a few Windows 8 apps, some of them fairly complex. I tried to develop a few really great apps but many of those projects never got done. The reason is the API (WinRT).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with something (that should be) trivial. Imagine you want to <strong>display HTML files with images, CSS, JS in a WebView</strong>. It is a common scenario for displaying downloaded manuals, interactive texts, etc. It can be done on Android, iOS and even on Windows Phone by copying the data to isolated storage and pointing the WebView there.</p>

<p>This scenario is impossible in WinRT. You can reference files in Isolated Storage (Local / Roaming folders) using the ms-appdata protocol, but the WebView does not work with it. You can use the NavigateToString method to display one HTML file, but all the images, CSS, JS references must be internet URLs, you cannot reference other local files. The only way around this issue is to inline all the CSS, JS and images (as base64) to the HTML file. Really messy, painful and slow and not really an option if you have JS reading XML files and inserting external images.</p>

                       <p>Uploading a file in ASP.NET MVC is very easy, but there is no easy way to detect the encoding of a uploaded text file. However you can use the fact if you try to read the file with a wrong encoding, you get an DecoderFallbackException. So how do you put everything together?</p>

<p>First, get a stream of the uploaded file.</p>

                       <p>While reading an article that had nothing in common with programming I came upon a sudden need to find a way to generate all the permutations of a list, or more exactly a string (it is just a list of characters). As lazy as I am I tried to google a few examples of C# code that does exactly that. I was horrified that programmers could come up with the complicated ways I found. Not to mention programmers writing a ton of unit test and classes before actualy writing the code that solves to problem.</p>

<p>The problem is naturally recursive. All the permutations of a list of n items consit of each of the n items combined with all the permutations of the list without the actual item. So if you have a list of let&#8217;s say items (a,b,c), all the permutations are (a+permutation((b,c)) + (b+permutations((a,c))) + (c+permutations((a,b)).</p>

<p>First I came up with F# code to solve it, after some yield googling:</p>
