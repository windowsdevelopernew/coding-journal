                       <p>Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time).</p>

<p>You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use [Reactive Extensions][1]. You can use Reactive Extensions directly on a TextBox representing the Search box, but if you use MVVM (and you should) you need to attach to the property associated with the Search box instead.</p>

<p>Suppose the ViewModel contains a string property called SearchTerm (with two-way binding to the Search box) and an event called PropertyChanged (used for the INotifyPropertyChanged implementation). We need to observe the changes of the SearchTerm property. There is no way to do it directly, we need to observe the PropertyChanged event instead.</p>

                       <p>When debugging a C# program in Visual Studio, I tend to always hover over the variables to glance at their values and structure instead of explicitly writing their names into the watch window. If I want to explore say a collection, I need to unfold each of the items using the + button to get an idea about the data:</p>

<p><img src="/images/debug1.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>This is not very comfortable, so thankfully, there is a way to make this experience better, using the [DebuggerDisplay][2] attribute. This attribute can be applied to any class (and struct, enum, property, field, delegate, assembly) and allows you to define the information about the class you wanto to see in the debugger.</p>

<p>In one use case I generate a ZIP file in the temp folder and I want the API to return this ZIP file. NancyFx contains a Responses.AsFile helper but it works only with paths relative to the application.</p>

<p>If you have an absolute path of a file, you cannot use it. You need to create a StreamResponse and return the file as an attachment</p>

                       <p>In the [previous post][1] I stated that a well-behaved Windows Store app should remeber the View the user navigated to before suspension and navigate to this View upon next run. The View can contain some input that the user can fill in. A well-behaved Windows Store app should remember the user&#8217;s input and restore it after suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Saving and restoring state</strong></p>

<p>Implementation of the above-mentioned scenario is not very complicated, thanks to the project setup. If you want your ViewModel to be able to save and restore state, implement the IHaveState interface. It contains two method that you can override; SaveState and LoadState. In bith method you have access to a page state dictionary that you can use to save and load the state.</p>

                       <p>In this second part you will add another ViewModel and View and implement navigation between two ViewModels, including saving the navigation state between starts. The code is as always [available at Github][1].</p>

<p><strong>Invoking ViewModel methods</strong></p>

<p>If you want to test out navigation between ViewModels, you first need something that will trigger the navigation. The easiest way to do this is to use a standard Button. If you do MVVM &#8220;by hand&#8221;, you are probably used to creating ICommand properties and binding them to the Button&#8217;s Command dependency property.</p>

<p>Caliburn Micro offers an easier way. If you want a Button to invoke a method on your ViewModel, just the give the button the same name as the name of the button. The method should be public void.</p>

                       <p>I have been developing Windows Store apps for some time. I have always used MVVM, but mostly &#8220;my own&#8221; MVVM. I have finally decided to use a &#8220;real&#8221; MVVM framework and I have chosen Caliburn Micro, because I did not like MVVM very much. In this article I am going to show you how to use Caliburn Micro, Unity and Fody to develop Windows Store apps.</p>

<p><strong>Caliburn Micro</strong></p>

<p>[Caliburn Micro][1] is a small, yet powerful framework, designed for building applications across all Xaml Platforms. With strong support for MVVM and other proven UI patterns, Caliburn.Micro will enable you to build your solution quickly, without the need to sacrifice code quality or testability.</p>

                       <p>I am currently working on a fairly large Windows Azure projects that among other things conatins a Web Role where I use [Ninject][1] as a dependency container. As the business logic library grew larger I found myself writing a lot of repeating boiler plate code to log exceptions in many important methods. I wantet to remove all the boiler plate code and create a custom attribute, say LogErrorAttribute with one simple goal: each method decorated woth this attribute should log info about any occuring exception.</p>

<p><strong>IL weaving?</strong></p>

<p>I have been using [Fody][2] for some time to [implement the INotifyPropertyChanged calls for me in Windows Phone and Windows 8 projects][3] so it was my first choice.</p>

<p>There is a [Fody.MethodDecorator][4] extensions that allows you to execute your code on a methods start, exit and exception. Writing the exception to Console is trivial, but I wanted to use a implementation of my custom ILogFactory.</p>

                       <p>I often wonder how can something as crucial as in-app purchases be so badly implemented in Windows Store. I really do not recommend anyone to use Windows Store&#8217;s built in in-app purchases. Use a third party provider or implement your own purchase mechanism, Microsoft is ok with that. You will be better of than using the built-in one. Here is why.</p>

<p><strong>Limited number of in-app purchases per app</strong></p>

<p>I previously wrote about the fact that [Windows Store limits the number of in-app purchases you can define for an app][1]. The current limit is 200. If you need more, say you sell a daily newspaper, you are out of luck and Windows Store&#8217;s in app-purchases are not for you.</p>

                       <p>In both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 the background agent is executed approximately every 30 minutes. If you want to run your code more often, for example to create an app showing actual time on the live tile, you are out of luck. Are you?</p>

<p>You can use [ScheduledActionService.LaunchForTest][1] to test your background agent without waiting 30 minutes for the system to run it. What if you use this method in the OnInvoke method of your background agent?</p>
