                       <p>I was offered to to take part in the Red Stripe Deal promotion on Windows Phone with my [Shopping List Simple][1] app from 21st August to 28th August.</p>

<img src="/images/sk.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>In this promotion, your app has to cost less than half of the normal price. The app normally costs 1.29 USD in most countries and 0.99 USD in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia to boost the sales. The minimum price in Windows Phone Store is 0.99 USD so the app had to be made free for the promotion. So I filled in the form saying that I want my app to be free in all the countries during the promotion. When the time of the promotion came, the price was set to free in all the countries except Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia. First day, first problem.</p>

                       <p>My MVVM framework of choice, Caliburn.Micro, provides a simple Dependency Injection container, where you have to register all your ViewModels and Services. This is done in the Bootstraper&#8217;s Configure method and may look like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=reg1.cs"></script>

<p>where you typically register your ViewModels as per request and services as singletons.</p>

<p>Of course this is done just once, but having to register a ViewModel each time you create a new one can be a nuisance, especially in a large project.</p>

                       <p>In my current project I needed to solve one quite interesting problem. Imagine you have a map with some pins representing points of interest. If the user taps on a pin, a label with the place title is shown like on this image (that is not from the real project, obviously).</p>

<img src="/images/image_thumb_4_4.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>The client had an interesting requirement. When the user taps the pin and the label is shown, they wanted the label to be centered on the map (basically move the map so the label appears in the middle of the map).</p>

                       <p>Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again). Ignoring certificate errors would be a much more comfortable approach. Of course, only do it in development with dev servers, not in production.</p>

<p>In Windows Phone 8.1 there are strangely two HttpClient classes, one in System.Net.Http and another in Windows.Web.Http. Normally you would go with the one in System.Net.Http because you are probably using it thanks to the mentioned Portable HTTP Client Libraries on every other platform. You are out of luck in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, if you want to ignore certificate errors, you have to use the one from Windows.Web.Http, because only this one accepts an IHttpFilter as an argument.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my [Pock8][1] app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE). This makes the app even more easy to use and valuable.</p>

<img src="/images/wp81.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>The problem is that [all the documentation I found][3] and also [the sample app][4] are for Windows Runtime. Pock8 is a Silverligt app and I have no intentions to rewrite it to Windows Runtime.</p>

<p>I had to make some digging and I finally found the solution in a build video called [Contracts and Pickers: Building Apps that Work Together on Windows][5].</p>

                       <p>If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator).</p>

<p>I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone Store does not offer developers any sandbox to test in-app purchases in their apps, like stores on other platforms do. If you want test in-app purchases in your Windows Phone apps, you need to use other options.</p>

<p>To make in-app purchases implementation easier, I created a simple Windows Phone Store service interface in my [Kulman.WP8][1] library (also [available on Nuget][2])</p>

                       <p>Recently I have released a new Windows Phone app called [Pock8][1]. Pock8 is a beautiful Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client for Windows Phone. The design of the app was created by Jan Marek who worked with my on the [Shopping List Simple][2] app.</p>

<img src="/images/pocket.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>Our goal was to create a Pocket client that would be really easy to use and that would have a nice and simple design. I think we have achieved our goal. The main features of the app are</p>

<ul>
<li>clean and simple design</li>
<li>optimized article view for comfortable reading</li>
<li>article cache for offline reading</li>
<li>dark theme for OLED screens or reading in the dark</li>
<li>support for receiving articles from other apps like WPCentral</li>
<li>listening to articles aloud</li>
<li>sharing articles</li>
</ul>

                       <p>In a recent larger ASP.NET MVC project running in Windows Azure I needed to provide the advanced users a way to execute custom scripts directly through the webbrowser. A kind of a scripting console where users can create and execute their own scripts, that interact with the project and automate some tasks (that would otherwise require too many clicks).</p>

<p><strong>Choosing the language</strong></p>

<p>I thought about using Lua but I needed an easy way to integrate with some classes (repositories) used in the project. I decided to use C# as the scripting language and implement the scripting console using [Roslyn][1]. Roslyn is a really neat project and I recommend taking a look at it, if you do not already know it.</p>

<p>I extracted the main idea of my implementation of the scripting console and [posted it on GitHub][2]. I will walk you through it in this blog post.</p>
