                       I have been developing Windows Phone apps for a few years now, always sticking to Silverlight and keeping using Silverlight also after Microsoft announced the WinRT flavor of Windows Phone apps and the so called Universal Apps. The Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 Silverlight APIs have some limitations, but are now well known do not contain many bugs. They are the safe choice if you want to create a Windows Phone apps.

                       I have been building Windows Phone apps using the Caliburn.Micro framework for some time now. Setting up a new project takes some time and can be easily automated, so I decided to create a Visual Studio template for Windows Phone apps build with Caliburn.Micro. The templates can be downloaded from the Visual Studio Extensions gallery and used to build Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps. It contains the basic setup with Caliburn Micro and Fody, with a sample view and viewmodel.

                       The about screen of a Windows Phone app is usually the most overlooked part of the app. Sure, the users usually visit it only once, after installing the app, if ever, but it is a part of your Windows Phone app that you could put to a good use. If you have ever taken a DVLUP challenge you may have noticed, that they recommend you place a text describing your app on the about screen.

                       In my current project I needed to solve one quite interesting problem. Imagine you have a map with some pins representing points of interest. If the user taps on a pin, a label with the place title is shown like on this image (that is not from the real project, obviously). The client had an interesting requirement. When the user taps the pin and the label is shown, they wanted the label to be centered on the map (basically move the map so the label appears in the middle of the map).

                       Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my Pock8 app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE).

                       If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator). I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1. Doing this in XAML for every page is not very convenient, a better solution

                       Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time). You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use Reactive Extensions.

                       In this installment of the series I will show you how user data services. We will finally use the Unity DI container that is part of the project setup. Data and Services In next installment we will be showing a list of products, so let&#8217;s create a simple Product class first in the Data directory: PropertyChangedBase is a base class implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and the ImplementPropertyChanged attribute makes sure it&#8217;s method is called for all the property changes.

                       In the previous post I stated that a well-behaved Windows Store app should remeber the View the user navigated to before suspension and navigate to this View upon next run. The View can contain some input that the user can fill in. A well-behaved Windows Store app should remember the user&#8217;s input and restore it after suspension. Saving and restoring state Implementation of the above-mentioned scenario is not very complicated, thanks to the project setup.
