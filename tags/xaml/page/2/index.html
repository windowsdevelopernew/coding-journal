                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>I have been developing Windows Phone apps for a few years now, always sticking to Silverlight and keeping using Silverlight also after Microsoft announced the WinRT flavor of Windows Phone apps and the so called Universal Apps. The Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 Silverlight APIs have some limitations, but are now well known do not contain many bugs. They are the safe choice if you want to create a Windows Phone apps. And do not forget that there are still many device running Windows Phone 8 (like Verizon customers in the US) that never got the 8.1 updated promised to everyone during the summer.</p>

<p><strong>Really universal?</strong></p>

<p>Windows Phone 8.1 XAML and Universal Apps included WinRT APIs that have many problems, including some that there is no solution for. I used the WinRT APIs when creating first Windows 8 apps about 2 years ago, so I am not new to the APIs. I have not touched the WinRT APIs again until recently, because there was no demand for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 apps. Why would it? People use Windows 8 or 8.1 but do not care about Metro apps, they give them no value compared to &#8220;normal&#8221; Win32 and Windows tablets are practically non-exists (expect for the Surface tablets owned by few programmers and maybe no one else).</p>

<p><strong>Universal Apps</strong></p>

<p>Recently, a client was thinking about adding a Windows Phone app for their service the its existing Android and iOS apps, but they did not think it was worth the money. So the local Microsoft branch told them they would pay for the app (seems like many of the app here are created this way) under two conditions. The app had to be a Universal App and had to be finished before the years end. The client agreed and I had to create a Universal App. And the problems started.</p>

<p>In theory, Universal Apps are supposed to make code sharing between Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 simple and allow you to reuse as much code as possible. This works on the trivial Microsoft samples, but try to create a real world app. I have a business logic project with API calls, storage, etc. in a portable class library (like I always did before Universal Apps existed) and I created an Universal App from the template. And the #ifdef hell started.</p>

<p><img src="/images/56995992.jpg" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p><strong>#ifdefs everywhere</strong></p>

<p>With Universal Apps you can safely share the ViewModels (I am using Caliburn.Micro) .. and that is about it. You have to create separate Views (because on phone and desktop information is typically displayed different), but the worst parts are the #ifdefs.</p>

<p>You need to set some properties of the main Frame, you have to use #ifdefs because the frame is a bit different on phone and desktop (like animations). You want to reuse as much DataTemplates as possible, so add another #ifdef for adding the right resource dictionary or many #ifdefs in the data templates to tune them, because it does not matter you use GridView on phone and GridView on desktop, they behave a bit differently in some cases.</p>

<p>Then you need to add audio playback to your app. There is a background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 and none for Windows 8.1 In Windows 8.1 you need a global MediaElement in your Frame and handling everything differently. So add another big #ifdef. And by the way, the background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 really sucks compared to the old Silverlight APIs. Just try downloading the <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/BackgroundAudio-63bbc319">sample form MSDN</a> and hitting Suspend and Resume in Visual Studio, the background agent crashes horribly, without any exception and takes your Visual Studio instance to hell with it. And of course, the background audio playback API does not work on some phones. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26175599/windows-phone-8-1-rt-backgroundmediaplayer-not-working">Just does not work</a>. I confirmed this finding with other developers. Another messed up API that used to work before the whole Universal Apps hype. And explain this to the client who sees that things like this work on iOS, work on Android, hell, they even for on Windows Phone 8.0 (Slivelight) apps.</p>

<p><strong>More messed up APIs</strong></p>

<p>So background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 is messed up, anything else? Sure. BackgroundDownloader is another example. In Silverlight, there was a BackgroundDownloader that was quite limited, but it worked. In Universal Apps, there is a new BackgroundDownloader with some new features, and some essential ones missing. For example, in Silverlight, each download could have a Tag, where you can store any data so you know something about the download when it finishes (to what business entity it belongs, etc.). Not any more in Universal Apps. There is no Tag, so you have to build and manage you own kind of index for all the downloads, so you can actually match them to your business entities. An annoyance, but nothing you cannot manage, right.</p>

<p>The BackgroundDownloader in Universal Apps has a bigger problem. It sometimes crashes so horribly, that it reboots the whole device! No exception, no logs, just a reboot. The maximum limit for the BackgroundDownloader is 1000 downloads, but try adding say 300 to the queue, cancelling them after a few minutes (does not seem to matter if you use one cancellation token or give each download its own) and there is a good chance the phone or the emulator will reboot itself. Not always, but quite often. Again, try explaining this issue to the client.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>In Silverlight, I commonly used the LongListSelector to display data, using it with a WrapPanel when I needed to create a two column layout. The LongListSelector is gone, in Universal Apps you have to use GridView also on Windows Phone. Or you can use the ListView with a custom wrap panel you write yourself or download somewhere, but it takes some effort to make it do virtualization properly.</p>

<p>So you use GridView on both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 to make it consistent. Add tens f of items with images to it and the performance starts to really suffer. Gray placeholders will show up and more importantly, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27488201/gridview-and-placeholders-that-never-disapper-in-windows-8-and-windows-phone-app">never disappears</a>. You do not event need images, just add about 300 text only items to the GridView and the gray placeholders will starts to show when scrolling.</p>

<p>Need another proof that the WinRT controls are slower? Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn5hVq6Q-zo">take a look at this video comparing the media app on and old Windows Phone 7 to the media app on a much more powerful device running Windows Phone 8.1</a>. You can see that the old, single core device runs the Silverlight apps faster than the new powerful phone runs the new WinRT equivalent of the app.</p>

                        <p>I have been building Windows Phone apps using the <a href="https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro">Caliburn.Micro</a> framework for some time now. Setting up a new project takes some time and can be easily automated, so I decided to create a Visual Studio template for Windows Phone apps build with Caliburn.Micro.</p>

<p>The templates can be downloaded from <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/21b4568e-1fb9-4881-9d51-8e1ea0160a9f">the Visual Studio Extensions gallery</a> and used to build Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps. It contains the basic setup with Caliburn Micro and <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/inotifypropertychanged-the-easy-way-in-windows-phone-and-windows-8/" title="INotifyPropertyChanged the easy way in Windows Phone and Windows 8">Fody</a>, with a sample view and viewmodel.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/CaliburnWP8AppVSIX">source code is available on GitHub</a>, so if you want to modify it to best suit your needs, feel free to do it.</p>

                        <p>The about screen of a Windows Phone app is usually the most overlooked part of the app. Sure, the users usually visit it only once, after installing the app, if ever, but it is a part of your Windows Phone app that you could put to a good use.</p>

<p>If you have ever taken a DVLUP challenge you may have noticed, that they recommend you place a text describing your app on the about screen. I really do not agree with this. If users install your app, they know what the app does and if they cannot figure it out, then your UI is a failure and the about screen will not save you.</p>

<p>After some trial and error I came up with a standardized about screen I now use in all my apps. It is a pivot with two tabs; About and More apps.</p>

<p>The About tab is the most important. It shows the version of the app, this is important when users report problems, information about the author and the designer of the app with Twitter contacts and buttons to send feedback via email and rate the app in the Windows Phone Store. Providing a feedback mechanism is really important, the users will write you about an issue they have with the app instead of just giving you a bad review in the Windows Phone Store.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about1.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The screenshot shows the About page from my latest app <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/tvtime-track-your-favorite-tv-shows-on-windows-phone/" title="TvTime: track your favorite TV shows on Windows Phone">TvTime</a>. You can easily get the app version from the manifest using the <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8/blob/master/Kulman.WP8/Code/ManifestHelper.cs">ManifestHelper</a> from the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP8/">Kulman.WP8 Nuget package</a>.</p>

<p>You should know that submitting an app is just a beginning, you then have to answer to user feedback, provide bug fixes, etc. In my case, the Feedback button launches an EmailComposeTask with filled in recipient and subject so the users just write what is on their minds and send it to me. I always answer each and every one of those feedback emails.</p>

<p>I use the second tab, More apps, as a form of cross-promotion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about2.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>If the users like your app, they may also like your other apps so why not make it easier for them to get them. I have a simple XML file with names, links and icons of my apps hosted on a webserver that the app downloads and displays, of course removing itself from the list.</p>

<p>To sum it all up, do not underestimate your about screen, use it to provide your users with a feedback mechanism. You will make your apps better.</p>

                        <p>In my current project I needed to solve one quite interesting problem. Imagine you have a map with some pins representing points of interest. If the user taps on a pin, a label with the place title is shown like on this image (that is not from the real project, obviously).</p>

<p><img src="/images/image_thumb_4_4.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The client had an interesting requirement. When the user taps the pin and the label is shown, they wanted the label to be centered on the map (basically move the map so the label appears in the middle of the map).</p>

<p>In Windows Phone you can only center the map to a GeoCoordinate. If you center the map to the tapped pin&#8217;s coordinate, it is not quite right, you also need to move it by half the width of the label to the left (and half of the height down). So the solution consists of two steps</p>

<ol>
<li>Convert half of the label width in pixels to meters for a given zoom level (pixels -&gt; meters conversion)</li>
<li>Subtract the result from the pin&#8217;s coordinate (meters -&gt; degrees conversion)</li>

<p>(and the same for height)</p>

<p>The map component in Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 has quite a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa940990.aspx">nice documentation</a>, so the first step requires some math but is not so difficult.</p>

<p>I created two helper functions to take care of this first conversion</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9fa0a229b9c2db57a172.js?file=meters.cs"></script>

<p>The second conversion is more difficult, especially if you want to do it really well. I found a <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2951/algorithm-for-offsetting-a-latitude-longitude-by-some-amount-of-meters">simple solution that works quite ok when you are not right at the poles</a> and used it. The helper function looks like this.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9fa0a229b9c2db57a172.js?file=coords.cs"></script>

<p>Now you just need to put it all together and you are done.</p>

                        <p>Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my <a href="http://t.co/YMtrM84rwI">Pock8</a> app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE). This makes the app even more easy to use and valuable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp81.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The problem is that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh871367.aspx">all the documentation I found</a> and also <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh871363.aspx">the sample app</a> are for Windows Runtime. Pock8 is a Silverligt app and I have no intentions to rewrite it to Windows Runtime.</p>

<p>I had to make some digging and I finally found the solution in a build video called <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-520">Contracts and Pickers: Building Apps that Work Together on Windows</a>.</p>

<p>First you have to add the <strong>Share Contract</strong> ability to the new manifest file (Package.appxmanifest, the Declarations tab). If you want to receive links, Choose <strong>weblink</strong> as data format. This step is the same for Windows Runtime and for Silverlight apps, but all the other steps differ.</p>

<p>You can determine if your application was launched normally or as a Share Contract target in the application Launching event. If you cast the <strong>LaunchingEventArgs</strong> to <strong>ShareLaunchingEventArgs</strong> and the result is not null, your application was launched as a Share Contract target. The video recommend creating an internal property of type <strong>ShareOperation</strong> in App.xaml.cs and saving the data from <strong>ShareLaunchingEventArgs</strong> there:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/11111043.js?file=AssociationUriMapper.cs"></script>

<p>(I use Caliburn.Micro so I do it in the OnLaunch method of the Bootstrapper)</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to show a separate sharing page instead of the page you would normally show when your app starts. Create a <strong>AssociationUriMapper</strong> like you <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206987(v=vs.105).aspx">would do when registering for a protocol</a> and simply check the <strong>ShareOperation</strong> property in App.xaml.cs:</p>

<p>If you use Caliburn.Micro as I do, do not forget to register the AssociationUriMapper in the Boostrappers CreatePhoneApplicationFrame method:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/11111043.js?file=CreatePhoneApplicationFrame.cs"></script>

                        <p>If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator).</p>

<p><img src="/images/line.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9572347.js?file=line.xaml"></script>

<p>Doing this in XAML for every page is not very convenient, a better solution would be to set the negative top margin on the whole application frame</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9572347.js?file=line.cs"></script>

<p>If you use Caliburn.Micro, you need to override the CreatePhoneApplicationFrame in the Bootstrapper instead</p>

                        <p>Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time).</p>

<p>You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Reactive Extensions</a>. You can use Reactive Extensions directly on a TextBox representing the Search box, but if you use MVVM (and you should) you need to attach to the property associated with the Search box instead.</p>

<p>Suppose the ViewModel contains a string property called SearchTerm (with two-way binding to the Search box) and an event called PropertyChanged (used for the INotifyPropertyChanged implementation). We need to observe the changes of the SearchTerm property. There is no way to do it directly, we need to observe the PropertyChanged event instead.</p>

<p>We need to create an observable from the PropertyChanged event, subscribe to it filtering only the PropertyChanged calls regarding the SearchTerm property, throttling for 0.5 seconds</p>

<p>Using the throttle operator we will get exactly the desired behaviour of executing the Search method 0.5 seconds after the user stopped typing.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/7657908.js"></script></p>

<p>However, there is a small problem. The SearchTerm property changes (and fires the PropertyChanged event) only when the Search box loses focus. We need to make the SearchTerm property change after each letter typed instead. In WPF that would be trivial using UpdateTrigger, but Windows Phone does not support UpdateTrigger.</p>

<p>We need to create a custom binding utility</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/7657969.js"></script></p>

<p>and apply it to the Search box</p>

                        <p>In this installment of the series I will show you how user data services. We will finally use the Unity DI container that is part of the project setup.</p>

<p><strong>Data and Services</strong></p>

<p>In next installment we will be showing a list of products, so let&#8217;s create a simple Product class first in the Data directory:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6606102.js"></script></p>

<p>PropertyChangedBase is a base class implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and the ImplementPropertyChanged attribute makes sure it&#8217;s method is called for all the property changes. (More about Fody <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/inotifypropertychanged-the-easy-way-in-windows-phone-and-windows-8/" title="INotifyPropertyChanged the easy way in Windows Phone and Windows 8">here</a>)</p>

<p>All the operations will be handled by a service implementing the IProductService interface:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6606127.js"></script></p>

<p>You can implement this interface any way you want. To keep things simple I chose an implementation with two hardcoded products:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6606170.js"></script></p>

<p><strong>Registering services</strong></p>

<p>All our services need to be registered with the Unity DI container before being used. The place to do it is the App class (App.xaml.cs file). You can override the Configure method to do it:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6607482.js"></script></p>

<p>This registers the ProductService class to the IProductService interface. The new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager() parameter is Unity&#8217;s way of setting the registration to be a singleton.</p>

<p><strong>Injecting services into ViewModel</strong></p>

<p>Injecting the ProductService into our MainViewModel is very simple. Just declare a IProductService variable and initialize it from constructor. Unity will take care of the rest:</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6607538.js"></script></p>

<p>Next time we will implement a typical master-detail scenario showing products usign the ProductService whe have created. All the code is again <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/CaliburnDemoWinRT">available at GitHub</a>.</p>

                        <p>In the <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/developing-windows-store-apps-with-caliburn-micro-part-2-navigation/" title="Developing Windows Store apps with Caliburn Micro Part 2: navigation">previous post</a> I stated that a well-behaved Windows Store app should remeber the View the user navigated to before suspension and navigate to this View upon next run. The View can contain some input that the user can fill in. A well-behaved Windows Store app should remember the user&#8217;s input and restore it after suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Saving and restoring state</strong></p>

<p>Implementation of the above-mentioned scenario is not very complicated, thanks to the project setup. If you want your ViewModel to be able to save and restore state, implement the IHaveState interface. It contains two method that you can override; SaveState and LoadState. In bith method you have access to a page state dictionary that you can use to save and load the state.</p>

<p>Let us reuse the SecondPageViewModel from the last post. Implement IHaveState, add two string properties and use the SaveState and LoadState method to save and load them using the page state dictionary</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6173564.js"></script></p>

<p>To test it, first add two TextBoxes to the SecondPageView with two-way binding</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6173636.js"></script></p>

<p>Now run the application, navigate to the SecondPageViewModel and fill in the TextBoxes. Switch to Visual Studio and invoke the Suspend and Shutdown command. When you run the application again, you will see the SecondPageViewModel with TextBoxes with the same values as before the suspension.</p>

<p>The code is again <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/CaliburnDemoWinRT">available at Github</a>. If you are interested in the implementation of saving and loading state, read <a href="http://nybbles.blogspot.cz/2013/02/winrt-caliburnmicro-and-ioc-part-3.html">this article</a>.</p>
