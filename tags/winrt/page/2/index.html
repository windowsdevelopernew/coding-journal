                       Sometimes you may want your app to display the startup splashscreen a bit longer, so you can initialize or fetch some data necessary for the app to run. To achieve this, you can create a fake splaschreen, a View that looks just like the splashscreen, does all the work and redirects to the real main View afterwards. In theory, it is quite simple: Create a SplashScreenView with just the right background and the splashscreen image Set the app to display SplashScreenView at startup Do all the initializing and data fetching in SplashScreenViewModel and redirect to there real MainView This works quite well with Windows 8.1, but on Windows Phone 8.1 there is a problem.

                       I have been developing Windows Phone apps for a few years now, always sticking to Silverlight and keeping using Silverlight also after Microsoft announced the WinRT flavor of Windows Phone apps and the so called Universal Apps. The Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 Silverlight APIs have some limitations, but are now well known do not contain many bugs. They are the safe choice if you want to create a Windows Phone apps.

                       Communicating with a JSON based REST service is a task that many Windows Phone apps have to do. My apps sure do it a lot so I came up with a base class that I use in all of them, put it on Github and created a Nuget package, so your apps could use it to. The usage of this base class is simple. Create your service class and inherit from BaseRestService.

                       My MVVM framework of choice, Caliburn.Micro, provides a simple Dependency Injection container, where you have to register all your ViewModels and Services. This is done in the Bootstraper&#8217;s Configure method and may look like this: where you typically register your ViewModels as per request and services as singletons. Of course this is done just once, but having to register a ViewModel each time you create a new one can be a nuisance, especially in a large project.

                       Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again).

                       In the previous post I stated that a well-behaved Windows Store app should remeber the View the user navigated to before suspension and navigate to this View upon next run. The View can contain some input that the user can fill in. A well-behaved Windows Store app should remember the user&#8217;s input and restore it after suspension. Saving and restoring state Implementation of the above-mentioned scenario is not very complicated, thanks to the project setup.

                       In this second part you will add another ViewModel and View and implement navigation between two ViewModels, including saving the navigation state between starts. The code is as always available at Github. Invoking ViewModel methods If you want to test out navigation between ViewModels, you first need something that will trigger the navigation. The easiest way to do this is to use a standard Button. If you do MVVM &#8220;by hand&#8221;, you are probably used to creating ICommand properties and binding them to the Button&#8217;s Command dependency property.

                       I have been developing Windows Store apps for some time. I have always used MVVM, but mostly &#8220;my own&#8221; MVVM. I have finally decided to use a &#8220;real&#8221; MVVM framework and I have chosen Caliburn Micro, because I did not like MVVM very much. In this article I am going to show you how to use Caliburn Micro, Unity and Fody to develop Windows Store apps. Caliburn Micro Caliburn Micro is a small, yet powerful framework, designed for building applications across all Xaml Platforms.

                       I often wonder how can something as crucial as in-app purchases be so badly implemented in Windows Store. I really do not recommend anyone to use Windows Store&#8217;s built in in-app purchases. Use a third party provider or implement your own purchase mechanism, Microsoft is ok with that. You will be better of than using the built-in one. Here is why. Limited number of in-app purchases per app I previously wrote about the fact that Windows Store limits the number of in-app purchases you can define for an app.
