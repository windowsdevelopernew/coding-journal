                        <p>Displaying PDF files in a mobile apps is a valid use case and there are many iOS and Android app that do it. WinRT has no APIs for displaying PDF files. The only thing you can do with a PDF in WinRT is to display it in the default PDF viewer app using the Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync method. This is typicaly not what you want to do. This method takes the user out of your app and more importantly the PDF can be copied, shared, etc.</p>

<p>There are a few 3rd party components for displaying PDF files in Windows Store apps, each has some problems and restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>ComponentOne PDFViewer</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.componentone.com">ComponentOne</a> has a <a href="http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/PdfViewerWinRT/">PDFViewer component</a> as part of their <a href="http://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/StudioWinRTXAML/">Studio for WinRT XAML</a> package. This package costs $895. There are <a href="http://helpcentral.componentone.com/nethelp/PdfViewerWinRT/#!Documents/pdfviewerlimitations1.htm">many limitations</a> when using this component that you need to be aware of. If you want to have more control over the rendered PDF files, you can get all the pages as FrameworkElements and do not need to use the PDFViewer as one monolitic component. It does not support all the fonts and complex documents are rendered really messed up, it was not usable for me at all.</p>

<p><strong>Foxit Embedded PDF SDK</strong></p>

<p>Foxit has a <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/sdk/embedded/winrt/">Embedded PDF SDK for Windows RT</a> and <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/sdk/embedded/win8/">Embedded PDF SDK for Windows Store Apps</a> (what is the difference?). If you want to try it, you have to fill in a registration form. There is no information about pricing and you need to fill in another form to ask for a quotation. You can get the pages of the PDF files as images if you want more control, but the component only works with StorageFiles. It cannot open a custom stream (e.g: file in isolated storage with custom encryption).</p>

<p><strong>TallComponents PDFRasterizer</strong></p>

<p>TallComponents has a PDFRasterizer component that is currently in beta. You need to <a href="https://www.tallcomponents.com/betaprogram.aspx">join the beta program</a> to get access. The final version should be out in 6-8 weeks. PDFRasterizer costs 1490â‚¬ for a single app. It is just a rasterizer, you can get the pages of the PDF files as images and that is all. It works well with differents fonts and complex documents.</p>

<p><strong>PDFTron Mobile PDF SDK</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pdftron.com/index.html">PDFTron</a> has a <a href="http://www.pdftron.com/pdfnet/mobile/windows8_winrt_pdf_library.html">Mobile PDF SDK</a> that works with Windows Store apps. To get a trial version you have to fill in a form where you have to describe your app. The pricing is not clear, it dependes on many factors and you need to write them an email to get a price. You can get pages from the PDF file but not in a usable format like an image.</p>

<p>So which PDF solution should you use? That dependes on your needs. I am afraid you will have to check each of them out by yourself and assess it according to your needs.</p>

                        <p>I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget.</p>

                        <p>Let&#8217;s face it, there are no really great apps for Windows 8 and the number of trashy apps is also very low compared to the Android and iOS ecosystems. Microsoft looks really desperate to bring more apps and developers to the ecosystem. Instead of improving the API and its capabilities, Microsoft just generates <a href="http://build.windowsstore.com/keepthecash">desperately looking campaigns to improve the apps count</a>. I sometimes wonder if they ever realize that the number of apps is not important when people cannot find the apps they are used to use on Android or iOS in the Windows Store.</p>

<p><img src="/images/microsoft-surface-2-650x0.jpg" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>So why are there so few Windows 8 apps? I will tell you my (and only my) opinion and experience. I developed a few Windows 8 apps, some of them fairly complex. I tried to develop a few really great apps but many of those projects never got done. The reason is the API (WinRT).</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with something (that should be) trivial. Imagine you want to <strong>display HTML files with images, CSS, JS in a WebView</strong>. It is a common scenario for displaying downloaded manuals, interactive texts, etc. It can be done on Android, iOS and even on Windows Phone by copying the data to isolated storage and pointing the WebView there.</p>

<p>This scenario is impossible in WinRT. You can reference files in Isolated Storage (Local / Roaming folders) using the ms-appdata protocol, but the WebView does not work with it. You can use the NavigateToString method to display one HTML file, but all the images, CSS, JS references must be internet URLs, you cannot reference other local files. The only way around this issue is to inline all the CSS, JS and images (as base64) to the HTML file. Really messy, painful and slow and not really an option if you have JS reading XML files and inserting external images.</p>

<p><del datetime="2013-03-21T17:08:20+00:00">There is another workaround pointed out by Javier Sosa in the comments. Instead of saving your files to Local / Roaming folders, save them to the installation folder of your app (Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation) and use the ms-appx-web protocol. The WebView can for some reason work with ms-appx-web but not with ms-appdata. Saving your data to the installation folder instead of data folders is quite messy in my opinion. Another problem is, that you cannot create folders in Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation. This means you have to preprocess your HTML,CSS,JS files and make the file structure flat.</del> Turns out this works only in debug, so it is not a viable workaround.</p>

<p>Let us continue with something as basic and common as Zip files. Windows 8 offers absolutely <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/tampering-with-windows-store-apps-data/">no protection of your locally saved files</a> so a client may want to at least use password protected Zip files. <strong>The ZipArchive class in WinRT does not support password protected Zip files</strong>. No 3rd party Zip library can be compiled in WinRT because of a missing Security namespace. You are out of luck, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15367922/ziparchive-with-password-in-windows-store-apps">there is no workaround</a> and it may be a deal-breaker for a security-conscious client.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress">SharpCompress</a> now supports WinRT! Get <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/sharpcompress/">version 0.9+ from Nuget</a>.</p>

<p>Let us assume that you want to create an interactive textbook app like there are a few on iOS. The apps should contain <strong>multimedia content like images, video, sounds, Word and Excel documents</strong>. You would assume that displaying (or better said previewing) Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel files on a Microsoft platform would be easy.Â You should have learned to limit your expectations and always assume the worst by now when dealing with WinRT. You can <a href="https://www.syncfusion.com/products/winrt">display Word documents with a component for $199</a> and <a href="https://www.componentone.com/SuperProducts/SpreadWinRT/">Excel sheets with one for $1195</a>. Previewing Microsoft Office documents on iOS is easy and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/QuickLook/Reference/QuickLookFrameworkReference_iPhoneOS/_index.html">built-in</a>.</p>

<p>Do you need your app to <strong>display PDF files</strong>? There are a few solutions, mainly in beta and each has some flaws. I will write a <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/displaying-pdf-files-in-windows-store-apps/">separate article about rendering PDF files in WinRT</a> but, again, be prepared to spend at least $900 for something that can be done for free on other platforms. Sure, you can send the PDF file to the default PDF viewer but that is usually not what you want. It takes the user out of your app and more importantly you cannot protected the PDF content from copying, sharing, etc.</p>

<p>Do not forget about the <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/few-thoughts-about-the-windows-phone-store-certification-process/">strange behavior of the Windows Store certification process</a> and the bugs.</p>

<p>I am really fed up with telling customers who want an (complex iOS clone) app the magic words &#8220;it is not possible in Windows 8&#8221;.</p>

                        <p>Before I start with the actual arguments I feel a need to state my background first so you do not mistake me with just another hater rattling about things he does not know. I have been a long time .NET developer, I have worked with winforms, webforms, mvc, compact framework. I really like C# and love F#. In February I started to work as a full time Windows Phone developer. Although I have been programming exclusively for Windows 8 for the last few months I have a ton of experience with Windows Phone programming.</p>

<p><strong>Good old Windows Phone 7 times</strong></p>

<p>I really like Windows Phone 7 as a programmer. Although capabilities of this mobile OS are very limited compared to other platforms, the things you can do can be done easily and reliably. The OS is based on Silverlight, which is a mature platform. Everything works as you would expect.</p>

<p><strong>The abomination called Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>When I first got my hands on a Windows Phone 8 phone I was really disappointed. I wrote two concrete post about <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/store-region-messed-up-in-windows-phone-8/">troubles with Windows Phone Store region</a> and an <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/htc-8x-windows-phone-8-and-playing-music/">unaccountable approach to MP3 tags</a> but lets take it more generally. Windows Phone 8 feels like Windows Phone 7 written from scratch using another technology, visually looking nearly the same but full of bugs and unfinished things. I am really amazed at things that worked on Windows Phone 7 but work much worse on Windows Phone 8. I thought that only Czech and Slovak people suffered from the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome but clearly it might be a more widespread disease.</p>

<p>The advocates of throwing away Silverlight and writing everything from scratch always tell you that it allows you to share your code with Windows 8, use the same APIs and program the same way. And they try hard to persuade you that all the Windows Phone 7 apps run great on Windows Phone 8. Neither of this statements are completely true.</p>

<p><strong>Running Windows Phone 7 apps on Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>The majority of Windows Phone 7 apps run ok on Windows Phone 8 but your own app never falls into that ok category. If you do not use any problematic APIs yours will be fine just with replacing all your graphic resources with a twice the size equivalent. And you should definitely do so, because all the icons and backgrounds look ugly scaled up on a high resolution phones like the HTC 8X. The splashcreens also look ugly scaled up but there is nothing you can do about it, a splashscreen in a Windows Phone 7 project must always be 480&#215;800.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206947(v=vs.105).aspx">some API incompatibilities</a> you should be aware of and also some undocumented problems. For instance if you use udp multicast, your application will not work on Windows Phone 8. It will join the multicast group but will neither send nor receive any packets. No error or exception thrown, it just will not work. What is even worse is that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13702991/is-there-a-way-to-opt-out-from-wp8-when-submiting-an-windows-phone-app/">you cannot opt-out from Windows Phone 8</a> in the Windows Phone Store. That means that if you upload your Windows Phone 7 app to the Windows Phone Store and you know that it does not work on Windows Phone 8, there is no way to ban it from being installed on Windows Phone 8 devices. At least no way for you, apps like WhatsApp can do it.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing code between Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>The biggest benefit of throwing away Silverlight and using the same kernel as Windows 8 should be the before-mentioned ability to share code when programming for both platforms. The Windows Phone 8 API is only a subset of the Windows 8 API (WinRT) so you cannot share everything. Take a simple task, downloading a string from the internet. In Windows Phone 7 you would use the WebClient class, in Windows 8 it is not available, so you have to go a bit deeper and use the HttpHandler class. There is no HttpHandler only WebClient so no sharing of code here. I can state many more examples.</p>

<p>Sometimes you find APIs in Windows Phone 8 from phone Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8 and you are very surprised by it (I was). One example can be that to store your app&#8217;s settings you can use IssolatesStorageSettings from Windows Phone 7 and ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings from Windows 8. It is a bit strange you say to yourself and choose to use the latter to be able to share the code with Windows 8. You implement your app using this Windows 8 API, the app compiles without problems and then you run the app. What do you get? A <a href="https://twitter.com/igorkulman/status/276698899689914368">NotImplementedException</a>! This makes me want to punch someone into the face. So why is this included in the API if it is not implemented? It should not be there or at least the compilers should warn you. There are many more Windows 8 APIs that will throw you a NotImplementedException.</p>

<p><strong>New era?</strong></p>

<p>Trying to say something positive; if you are a C++, web or game developer that you can use for skill in Windows Phone 8 programming, if you for some reason decide to target this (to be honest with ourselves) irrelevant mobile platform. If you are a C# developer the Windows Phone 8 development sucks for you. The same can be said about Windows 8 development, where creating a content app in HTML is much easier that trying to bend XAML to your needs (maybe I will write a separate post about this). Quite an interesting twist, would you not say?</p>

                        <p>When navigating in a Windows Store app, you can specify a navigation parameter. This navigation parameter can be any object but there is a problem. When the application is suspended, this navigation parameter is saved by the LayoutAwarePage. This works only with primitive data types, unless you change the implementation of the class which instances you pass as the navigation parameter.</p>

<p>I use mainly ints (article id, gallery id &#8230;) as navigation parameters but sometimes just on int is not enough. If I want to pass two int parameters, I &#8220;encode&#8221; them into an int and then &#8220;decode&#8221; back on the target page. I have a simple Utils class for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>There is no AutoCompleteBox control that can be used when building Windows Store apps in C# and XAML so I decided to create one, because I needed it for a project. Currently it supports only String collections and the selected value must be accessed using code behind, but this will hopefully change.</p>

<p>The AutoCompleteBox uses <a href="http://winrtxamltoolkit.codeplex.com/">WinRT XAML Toolkit</a> to show the watermark and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Reactive Extensions</a> so the users does not need to press enter, the results will show after they stop typing for a second.</p>

<p>The project is hosted on my Bitbucket so you can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox">https://github.com/igorkulman/AutoCompleteBox</a>, forks and code contributions are welcomed. Nuget package is available at <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT">https://nuget.org/packages/AutoCompleteBoxWinRT</a>.</p>

<p>Installation using Nuget:</p>

<pre><code>Install-Package AutoCompleteBoxWinRT

                        <p>When I had to create a library to generate UI elements with animated image Ads I found out that creating complicated UI elements in code with bindings is not as easy as doing the same in XAML. A better way is to create your UI elements and bindings in a XAML file (if they are not very dynamic of course), load the XAML at runtime, parse it and set its DataContext.</p>

<p>First you need to read the XAML file. You can use the standard API with Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation as the folder. The XAML file must be set to Build=Content in your project</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849482.js"></script></p>

<p>Once you have the XAML read as string, you can use the XamlReader and cast it to a DependencyObject.</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849490.js"></script></p>

<p>or a more concrete class like UserControl if you know what the file contains.</p>

                        <p>If you ever generated a MD5 or SHA hash in C# you problaby uset the classes from the System.Security.Cryptography namespace. This namespace is not available in WinRT, you have to use the Windows.Security.Cryptography.Core instead. This namespace contians a class called HashAlgorithmProvider that can be used to generate hashes using MD5 and SHA (SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512). A simple method to generate a hash for a string using a given algorithm may look like this</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5849454.js"></script></p>

<p>Specifing the algoritm by its string name is not a good idea in my opinion, although you can use the names from the HashAlgorithmNames class. I would rather make the GetHash method private and create public method for all the algorithms</p>

                        <p>Windows Store apps run in a sandbox with their data isolated from each other. So how secure is this storage from tampering by the user? It turns out not much.</p>

<p>The only Windows Store app I use on my work notebook is WeatherFlow because of the live tile. The app allows you to add your city and view weather forecast for it. But there is now way to get rid of the default cities like New York, Tokyo, etc. that are in the app when you first run it. This realy annoyed me so I started to poke around.</p>

<p>Using the debugger and checking the value of ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder I found out that all the data of Windows Store apps are stored in AppData\Local\Packages in your profile (for me it is C:\Users\Igor\AppData\Local\Packages). The name of the directory for the app you are lookin for usualy contain its name, it is 08C8076A.WeatherFlow_gyyqpbm0tqk6g for WeatherFlow. The directory for each app contains a few subdirectories</p>

<p>AC</p>

<p>LocalState</p>

<p>RoamingState</p>

<p>Settings</p>

<p>SystemAppData</p>

<p>TempState</p>

<p>The important directories are LocalState and RoamingState representing the local and roaming folder, where each application can store its files. WeatherFlow uses only LocalState where it stores one data.json file with its configuration. You can edit the file and remove the unwanted city, then run the application again and it still works, with the changes you made.</p>

<p>Now imaging editing files of a game, giving yourself gold coins or armor, or copying files somewhere else, sharing &#8230; If you want the data of your Windows Store app to be secured, you have to do it by yourself.</p>
