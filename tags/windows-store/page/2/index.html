                        <p>The about screen of a Windows Phone app is usually the most overlooked part of the app. Sure, the users usually visit it only once, after installing the app, if ever, but it is a part of your Windows Phone app that you could put to a good use.</p>

<p>If you have ever taken a DVLUP challenge you may have noticed, that they recommend you place a text describing your app on the about screen. I really do not agree with this. If users install your app, they know what the app does and if they cannot figure it out, then your UI is a failure and the about screen will not save you.</p>

<p>After some trial and error I came up with a standardized about screen I now use in all my apps. It is a pivot with two tabs; About and More apps.</p>

<p>The About tab is the most important. It shows the version of the app, this is important when users report problems, information about the author and the designer of the app with Twitter contacts and buttons to send feedback via email and rate the app in the Windows Phone Store. Providing a feedback mechanism is really important, the users will write you about an issue they have with the app instead of just giving you a bad review in the Windows Phone Store.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about1.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The screenshot shows the About page from my latest app <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/tvtime-track-your-favorite-tv-shows-on-windows-phone/" title="TvTime: track your favorite TV shows on Windows Phone">TvTime</a>. You can easily get the app version from the manifest using the <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8/blob/master/Kulman.WP8/Code/ManifestHelper.cs">ManifestHelper</a> from the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP8/">Kulman.WP8 Nuget package</a>.</p>

<p>You should know that submitting an app is just a beginning, you then have to answer to user feedback, provide bug fixes, etc. In my case, the Feedback button launches an EmailComposeTask with filled in recipient and subject so the users just write what is on their minds and send it to me. I always answer each and every one of those feedback emails.</p>

<p>I use the second tab, More apps, as a form of cross-promotion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/about2.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>If the users like your app, they may also like your other apps so why not make it easier for them to get them. I have a simple XML file with names, links and icons of my apps hosted on a webserver that the app downloads and displays, of course removing itself from the list.</p>

<p>To sum it all up, do not underestimate your about screen, use it to provide your users with a feedback mechanism. You will make your apps better.</p>

                        <p>My MVVM framework of choice, Caliburn.Micro, provides a simple Dependency Injection container, where you have to register all your ViewModels and Services. This is done in the Bootstraper&#8217;s Configure method and may look like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=reg1.cs"></script>

<p>where you typically register your ViewModels as per request and services as singletons.</p>

<p>Of course this is done just once, but having to register a ViewModel each time you create a new one can be a nuisance, especially in a large project.</p>

<p>There is a better way that uses reflection. First, you need to create attributes that will represent registration as per request and a s singleton:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=PerRequest.cs"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=Singleton.cs"></script>

<p>Iterating over all the non-abstract classes in your assemblies using reflection is quite easy, the tricky part is deciding when to register a class as &#8220;itself&#8221; and when to register it for an interface it implements. My rule of thumbs is that if the class implements exactly one interface, it is one of my services and I register it for that interface, otherwise I register it as itself (ViewModels descendant from Screen implement circa 5 interfaces).</p>

<p>The final registration code looks different for WinRT (Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 XAML)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=reg2.cs"></script>

<p>and for &#8220;classic&#8221; .NET (Windows Phone 8)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=reg3.cs"></script>

<p>because of reflection differences in WinRT. Do not forget to add the PerRequest or Singleton attribute to your classes to make it work.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Some time ago I needed a way to programatically search the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store to get some info about apps for a project. I decided to write an F# script for that task and later added support for Windows Phone Store.</p>

<p><strong>Types</strong></p>

<p>I wanted the script to be easily usable from outside of F# so first I created a type for the app.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=types.fs"></script>

<p>I also needed a helper function to download data from the web. I used a classic WebClient with user agent set to Chrome, because the Windows Phone Store API requires a user agent header</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=net.fs"></script>

<p><strong>Apple AppStore</strong></p>

<p>Searching in Apple AppStore is easy, because Apple provides a simple search API that returns JSON. Thanks to the JsonProvider from FSharp.Data, the code is really simple</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=AppStore.fs"></script>

<p>Just downloading the JSON transforming the data to our type.</p>

<p><strong>Google Play Store</strong></p>

<p>Searching in Google Play Store is a bit more of a challenge. There is no API I could found so I had to parse the html returned from the web version of Google Play Store. The web can change at any time so I need to be aware of this fact and fix the method if it happens.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=PlayStore.fs"></script>

<p>Another problem with parsing the web is that there is no way to return search result for a specific country like for Apple AppStore. The web always shows results according to your IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Phone Store</strong></p>

<p>There is no official API for searching the Windows Phone Store but I was given a tip obtained after sniffing the traffic from a Windows Phone, so I did not have to parse the web. The code is as simple as for Apple AppStore thanks to XmlProvider.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=WindowsPhoneStore.fs"></script>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Using F# is fun and processing data is really simple thanks to type provides. You can find it whole code at <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/AppStoreCrawler">https://github.com/igorkulman/AppStoreCrawler</a>.</p>

                        <p>Windows Phone Store does not offer developers any sandbox to test in-app purchases in their apps, like stores on other platforms do. If you want test in-app purchases in your Windows Phone apps, you need to use other options.</p>

<p>To make in-app purchases implementation easier, I created a simple Windows Phone Store service interface in my <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8">Kulman.WP8</a> library (also <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Kulman.WP8/">available on Nuget</a>)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9571908.js?file=IWindowsPhoneStoreService.cs"></script>

<p><strong>Private beta</strong></p>

<p>If you publish your app as a private beta and add the in-app products, you can test them. All the in-app purchases are always free in this scenario. The disadvantage is that you cannot debug anything, it either works or it does not (if you use my <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8/blob/master/Kulman.WP8/Services/WindowsPhoneStoreService.cs">implementation from Kulman.WP8</a>, it should :).</p>

<p><strong>Real app testing</strong></p>

<p>If your app is already in the Windows Phone Store, create an in-app product and try to buy it from your app run from Visual Studio, you may be wondering, why you are getting an error. The problem is that the app run from Visual Studio has a different app id from the app in Windows Phone Store. If you change the app id in the manifest to the app id state in Windows Phone Store (the details view), you will be able to make a real in-app purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Mocking library</strong></p>

<p>To mock in-app purchases you can use the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wpapps/Mock-In-App-Purchase-33080f0c">Mock In-App Purchase Library</a>. To make testing easier, implement my interface using this library</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/9571846.js"></script></p>

<p>And setup the products you want to use at your app startup</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9571908.js?file=SetupMockIAP.cs"></script>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that you just switch the IWindowsStoreService implementation between then mock on and the <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WP8/blob/master/Kulman.WP8/Services/WindowsPhoneStoreService.cs">real one</a>, depending on the situation. For example (Caliburn.Micro Bootstrapper)</p>

                        <p>In the <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/developing-windows-store-apps-with-caliburn-micro-part-2-navigation/" title="Developing Windows Store apps with Caliburn Micro Part 2: navigation">previous post</a> I stated that a well-behaved Windows Store app should remeber the View the user navigated to before suspension and navigate to this View upon next run. The View can contain some input that the user can fill in. A well-behaved Windows Store app should remember the user&#8217;s input and restore it after suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Saving and restoring state</strong></p>

<p>Implementation of the above-mentioned scenario is not very complicated, thanks to the project setup. If you want your ViewModel to be able to save and restore state, implement the IHaveState interface. It contains two method that you can override; SaveState and LoadState. In bith method you have access to a page state dictionary that you can use to save and load the state.</p>

<p>Let us reuse the SecondPageViewModel from the last post. Implement IHaveState, add two string properties and use the SaveState and LoadState method to save and load them using the page state dictionary</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6173564.js"></script></p>

<p>To test it, first add two TextBoxes to the SecondPageView with two-way binding</p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/6173636.js"></script></p>

<p>Now run the application, navigate to the SecondPageViewModel and fill in the TextBoxes. Switch to Visual Studio and invoke the Suspend and Shutdown command. When you run the application again, you will see the SecondPageViewModel with TextBoxes with the same values as before the suspension.</p>

<p>The code is again <a href="https://github.com/igorkulman/CaliburnDemoWinRT">available at Github</a>. If you are interested in the implementation of saving and loading state, read <a href="http://nybbles.blogspot.cz/2013/02/winrt-caliburnmicro-and-ioc-part-3.html">this article</a>.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>I often wonder how can something as crucial as in-app purchases be so badly implemented in Windows Store. I really do not recommend anyone to use Windows Store&#8217;s built in in-app purchases. Use a third party provider or implement your own purchase mechanism, Microsoft is ok with that. You will be better of than using the built-in one. Here is why.</p>

<p><strong>Limited number of in-app purchases per app</strong></p>

<p>I previously wrote about the fact that <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/windows-store-limits-the-number-of-in-app-purchases-for-an-app/">Windows Store limits the number of in-app purchases you can define for an app</a>. The current limit is 200. If you need more, say you sell a daily newspaper, you are out of luck and Windows Store&#8217;s in app-purchases are not for you.</p>

<p><strong>Complicated receipt validation outside of .NET</strong></p>

<p>If you use in-app purchases you surely want to validate them on your server, especially considering the very weak security that Windows 8 offers to Windows Store apps. If you are not using .NET on your server, there is no guide on how to do it. Microsoft only offers a code sample in C#, nothing else. Good luck finding a solution for say PHP, I could not find any.</p>

<p><strong>Half-baked purchases restoration</strong></p>

<p>If a user uninstalls your app and installs it again you typically do not want him to need to buy everything again. You need a way to restore the purchases. If you do not use server-side receipt validation, it is trivial, even more trivial than cracking your application and getting everything for free. If you use server-side receipt validation, things get complicated.</p>

<p>Restoring purchases is typically done in a very simple way. You request all the receipts from the app store and send them to your server for validation. The server then enables the bought items for the user. I would not be Windows Store if there were no catch.</p>

<p>The problem is that you can get the receipt just once, when the users makes the in-app purchase. There is no way to get the receipt at any later time. There is a method called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.store.currentapp.getproductreceiptasync.aspx">GetProductReceiptAsync</a> but it throws an NotImplementedException. Looks like Microsoft did not really think that anyone would want to restore purchases in combination with server-side validation (Typical use-case in say AppStore).</p>

<p>The only way to implement this is storing all the receipts on the server and sending the server receipt ids when restoring purchases. You can get the receipt ids from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.store.currentapp.getappreceiptasync.aspx">GetAppReceiptAsync</a> after some XML parsing. Just make sure the receipt gets to the server after the purchase, because there is no way to get it again.</p>

<p><strong>No sandbox for testing</strong></p>

<p>You cannot do any &#8220;real&#8221; testing with Windows Store. It does not provide any sanbox. The only way to test the in-app purchases is to use the primitive <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.applicationmodel.store.currentappsimulator">CurrentAppSimulator</a> that can basically just simulate if the users cliked ok or cancel in the buy dialog or if there was an error. You cannot use it to test you server-side receipt validation.</p>

<p>There is no way to &#8220;pair&#8221; your app running form Visual Studio to you app defined in Windows Store for testing purposes. You really need to trust your implementation and you can test it only after the app is published and live in Windows Store.</p>

                        <p>I recently discovered two really neet tools that helped me with Windows Store app development.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Store Icon Maker</strong></p>

<p>When creating a Windows Store or Windows 8 apps, there are many icon sizes you have to provide. If you do nont wat to do all the resizing by yourself, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/DavidBurela/WindowsMarketplaceIconMaker">Windows Store Icon Maker</a>. It is a fork of the <a href="http://wpiconmaker.codeplex.com/">Windows Phone Icons Maker</a> with added support for Windows Store apps. It takes a 300x300px icon as input and outputs all the square icons you need.</p>

<p><strong>HAMMER.Pants</strong></p>

<p>To brand Windows Store apps written in XAML, you need to override all the control styles. This sucks if you just want to change the colours to match your theme. <a href="https://github.com/Code52/HAMMER">HAMMER.Pants</a> solves this, by auto-modifying all the coloured brushes so you don&#8217;t have to pick through them. Currently, you provide a &#8220;base&#8221; colour, and HAMMER.Pants modifies that based on the luminance variation found in the original styles. That is, if you pick red, all the purples will be replaced with reds, but they&#8217;ll change in brightness slightly just like the default purples do.</p>

                        <p>Windows 8 development has <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/why-are-there-no-great-windows-8-apps-because-of-winrt-a-developers-view/">many problems and pitfalls because of WinRT</a>. Windows Store, the only distribution channel for Windows 8 apps, has some problems too. One of them is really serious for everyone who wants to create a newspaper or newsreader app with in-app purchases.</p>

<p>We developed a Windows 8 app for a local newspaper. The content consists of issues, there is one issue published each work day. The users can buy the issues using in-app purchases. The problem is that there is a limit of <del datetime="2013-05-26T14:03:17+00:00">100</del> 200 in-app purchases that can be defined for a single app in Windows Store. I really do not know what would Microsoft impose such a limit.</p>

<p>As far as I know there is no way around the limit. We need to either delete in-app purchases for old issues so user will no longer be able to buy them (which is stupid and as ot turns out not possible) or create new app with a different name and in-app purchases for another time period (which is even more stupid).</p>

<p>Sure you can implement content purchasing using other ways, but they all have one big problem. There is no way your app can get the identity of the user. If you implement your own purchasing mechanism, you cannot pair the purchases with the user, only with the device. So the user would have to buy the same content on each device, if he reinstall his system, etc. That is usually not what you want.</p>

                        <p>Passing the certification in Windows Phone Store and Windows Store can be a very painful process, but after a few tries you get enough experience to pass your apps on the first try. You may sometimes get a tester who is really dumb and fails your app for a made up reason but usually it is just enough to submit it again so another testers gets to test it. Lately I have been seeing a strange shift in the testing quality done in the certification process.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Phone Store</strong></p>

<p>The certification process used to discover bugs I overlooked, so it was quite useful sometimes. But it is not anymore. Let me give you an example. I wanted to change one of my Windows Phone apps from free to paid with a 3 day trial. I have this functionality implemented in another of my apps so I simply copied the trial page, set is as the start page. I tested it in trial mode, it showed, in purchased mode, the app showed the real start page. I was under the impression that everything worked just fine.</p>

<p>The app update passed the certification process without problems although it had one serious flaw discovered by new users. When a user started the app in trial mode, the trial page was shown. The trial page consisted of two buttons. One button to buy the app and another button to continue the trial. The button to continue the trial made the app crash. It is definitely my fault for not testing it properly but what did the Microsoft tester do for 5 days that they did not discover this bug? They may have tested in in purchased mode only, but that does not make any sense. I am inclined to believe the did not test it at all, just held it for 5 days.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Store</strong></p>

<p>The certification requirements for Windows Store apps are more strict that the ones in the Windows Phone Store. The testers can fail you for reasons like &#8220;the app does not do anything useful&#8221;. And they sometimes do when they do not get what your app is supposed to do, usually when your app is not in English. The rule that the app should do something useful is a great rule in my opinion. But take a look at the Windows Store, there are tons of trashy apps that are not useful.</p>

<p>Another problematic rule is the rule that your app must be (or seem) finished, especially when you combine this rule with a dumb tester. I had problems with this rule with my tv guide app. It got rejected many times because the tester complained he could not watch tv using the app. I had to write a note explaining what a tv guide means and keep resubmitting it until I found an intelligent tester.</p>

<p>On the other hand when I updated one Windows Store app and broke half the functionality in the process (I am not a very thorough tester) nobody complained and the app passed the certification process in a few hours.</p>

<p>My experience is that the certification process in both store works very strange. They fail you for made up reasons and pass your apps when they are broke. Maybe there is something broken with the process.</p>
