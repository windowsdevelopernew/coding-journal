                       I have been building Windows Phone apps using the Caliburn.Micro framework for some time now. Setting up a new project takes some time and can be easily automated, so I decided to create a Visual Studio template for Windows Phone apps build with Caliburn.Micro. The templates can be downloaded from the Visual Studio Extensions gallery and used to build Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight apps. It contains the basic setup with Caliburn Micro and Fody, with a sample view and viewmodel.

                       My MVVM framework of choice, Caliburn.Micro, provides a simple Dependency Injection container, where you have to register all your ViewModels and Services. This is done in the Bootstraper&#8217;s Configure method and may look like this: where you typically register your ViewModels as per request and services as singletons. Of course this is done just once, but having to register a ViewModel each time you create a new one can be a nuisance, especially in a large project.

                       Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my Pock8 app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE).

                       Recently I have released a new Windows Phone app called Pock8. Pock8 is a beautiful Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client for Windows Phone. The design of the app was created by Jan Marek who worked with my on the Shopping List Simple app. Our goal was to create a Pocket client that would be really easy to use and that would have a nice and simple design. I think we have achieved our goal.

                       Having a Search box in a Windows Phone app is a common use-case but it is only rarely done right. A good Search box does not have a Search button associated with it that the users have to click when they are finished typing and want to start the search. A good Search box starts the search immediately when the user stops typing (for a certain period of time). You can implement this functionality with some nasty code using a DispatcherTimer, or you can use Reactive Extensions.

Data and Services In next installment we will be showing a list of products, so let&#8217;s create a simple Product class first in the Data directory: PropertyChangedBase is a base class implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and the ImplementPropertyChanged attribute makes sure it&#8217;s method is called for all the property changes.

                       In the previous post I stated that a well-behaved Windows Store app should remeber the View the user navigated to before suspension and navigate to this View upon next run. The View can contain some input that the user can fill in. A well-behaved Windows Store app should remember the user&#8217;s input and restore it after suspension. Saving and restoring state Implementation of the above-mentioned scenario is not very complicated, thanks to the project setup.

                       In this second part you will add another ViewModel and View and implement navigation between two ViewModels, including saving the navigation state between starts. The code is as always available at Github. Invoking ViewModel methods If you want to test out navigation between ViewModels, you first need something that will trigger the navigation. The easiest way to do this is to use a standard Button. If you do MVVM &#8220;by hand&#8221;, you are probably used to creating ICommand properties and binding them to the Button&#8217;s Command dependency property.
