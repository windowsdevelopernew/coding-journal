                       <p>Windows Store apps run in a sandbox with their data isolated from each other. So how secure is this storage from tampering by the user? It turns out not much.</p>

<p>The only Windows Store app I use on my work notebook is WeatherFlow because of the live tile. The app allows you to add your city and view weather forecast for it. But there is now way to get rid of the default cities like New York, Tokyo, etc. that are in the app when you first run it. This realy annoyed me so I started to poke around.</p>

<p>Using the debugger and checking the value of ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder I found out that all the data of Windows Store apps are stored in AppData\Local\Packages in your profile (for me it is C:\Users\Igor\AppData\Local\Packages). The name of the directory for the app you are lookin for usualy contain its name, it is 08C8076A.WeatherFlow_gyyqpbm0tqk6g for WeatherFlow. The directory for each app contains a few subdirectories</p>

                       <p>When developing a Windows 8 app you may need to uniquely identify the device the app runs on. One reason may be the implementation of in-app purchases.</p>

<p>The Windows.System.Profile namespace contains HardwareToken that you can get by calling HardwareIdentification.GetPackageSpecificToken(null)</p>

                       <p>Many programmers learn one platform, one language and stay in their monoculture. Learning many different programming languages can definitely change your programming style and the way you think about problems. It was certainly beneficial for me, here is why.</p>

<p>After learning Pascal, C in the first semester at the University I started be commercial programming career as a PHP developer (part time in the second semester).  It was easy to start with and in demand so finding a part time job was easy. I never liked the language, it was not &#8220;pure&#8221;, I especially hated the function naming and parameters orders inconsistencies.</p>

<p>At the university I learned OOP principles and C++ and thought OOP was the answer to everything so I immediately changed my PHP programming style to incorporate it. My code became more readable and organized.  Later at the university I had to learn nonprocedural Prolog and functional Haskell. I found it very difficult because I had to think in another way and came out of my comfort zone. When I finished the course I really liked Haskell and functional programming because of its clarity, readability and the fact that I could write a very compact code. But I had no practical use for it. It did not change my Programming style but made me look for a more pure and &#8220;nicer&#8221; language to learn.</p>

                       <p>JSON is a very popular format for exchanging data, especially in the world of web technologies and JavaScript. The .NET platform contains a native support for this format but a better alternative is to use the JSON.NET library.</p>

<p><strong>JSON.NET</strong></p>

<p>[JSON.NET][1] is a flexible JSON serializer for .NET with LIQN support. The biggest reason for using this library is its performance in comparison to the standard DataContractJsonSerializer. The easiest way to use the library is to use the [Nuget package][2].</p>

<p>JSON.NET is very easy to use; first you create a JObject instance</p>

                       <p>GridView and ListView are the two of the most commonly used components in Windows 8 apps. Items in these two components are displayed according to the DataTemplate give as the ItemTemplate property. If you do not want to display all the items the same way, you need to use a custom ItemTemplateSelector.</p>

<p>Using ItemTemplateSelector in Windows 8 apps is easier and more straightforward that in Windows Phone 7 (I wrote about that [here in Slovak][1]). All you need to do is to create a class inheriting from the DataTemplateSelector and set the ItemTemplateSelector property of GridView (or ListView) to this new class.</p>

                       <p>The StorageFolder class does not containt any method to determine if a file with given name exists in that folder. There are at least two ways how to implement such method, let us call it ContainsFileAsync.</p>

<p>The first method could take advantage of the GetFilesAsync method that returns a readonly list of all the files in a folder as StorageFile objects. The StorageFile contains a property called Name that you could compare with the given filename. The whole code would look like this</p>

                       <p>From time to time I need to develop or maintain a small Windows Azure project. This time I wanted to create the whole project in F#. The first thing I needed to to was to update the Azure toolkit 1.8 (October 2012) but updating Azure Toolkit is always a pain. I started Web Platform Installer, selected Azure Toolkit 1.8, Azure Tools 1.8 for VS2012 and installed everything including the dependencies. What was the result? The whole Azure integration in Visual Studio 2012 stopped working. The Azure templates completely disappeared and Visual Studio only offered me downloading the Azure Toolkit, which failed, because it was already installed. I ended up completely uninstalling everything with the name containing Azure and installing the Azure toolkit again using the link from Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Why cannot this work better?</p>

                       <p>Semantic zoom is an important part of all Windows 8 apps, it is a distinctive feature that differentiates them from other platforms. The SemanticZoom component works fine if you want the default experience, but if you want some customization you have to try a bit harder.</p>

<p>The problem with the SemanticZoom component is, that as a child of it&#8217;s Semantic­Zoom.ZoomedIn­View and SemanticZoom.Zo­omedOutView elements, displaying the two states, you can use only two standard components; GridView and ListView. You cannot use the Grid and show mixed content. If you use one of these components, then clicking on any item in the zoomed out state shows you the group in the zoomed in state. You cannot implement any custom behaviour, the ItemClick event gets completely ignored. So how do you customize the SemanticZoom component?</p>

                       <p>I have been playing with the idea of having a coding blog in English for some time now. I have written some posts about programming in C# and Windows Phone 7 on my Slovak web, but I wanted to address a wider audience. I plan to publish one post per week, mainly about WinRT programming. I want the posts to be useful and solve a particular problem I stumble upon in my work developing Windows Store apps.</p>

<p>If you understand Slovak, definetely check my web [www.kulman.sk][1]</p>

                       First, I installed a few Visual Studio extensions that that leverage Roslyn and acts as code analyzers (in addition to the extensions I normally use) AsyncFixer C# Essentials Exception Analyzer Refactoring Essentials And MVVM-Tools to replace the Navigate between XAML View and ViewModel Resharper plugin. Then I did some keyboard shortcuts remapping to keep the Resharper shortcuts I am used to and make them invoke native Visual Studio functions Ctrl+, -&gt; Ctrl+T (navigate to any) Ctrl+.
