                       <p>The about screen of a Windows Phone app is usually the most overlooked part of the app. Sure, the users usually visit it only once, after installing the app, if ever, but it is a part of your Windows Phone app that you could put to a good use.</p>

<p>If you have ever taken a DVLUP challenge you may have noticed, that they recommend you place a text describing your app on the about screen. I really do not agree with this. If users install your app, they know what the app does and if they cannot figure it out, then your UI is a failure and the about screen will not save you.</p>

<p>After some trial and error I came up with a standardized about screen I now use in all my apps. It is a pivot with two tabs; About and More apps.</p>

                       <p>I was offered to to take part in the Red Stripe Deal promotion on Windows Phone with my [Shopping List Simple][1] app from 21st August to 28th August.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sk.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>In this promotion, your app has to cost less than half of the normal price. The app normally costs 1.29 USD in most countries and 0.99 USD in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia to boost the sales. The minimum price in Windows Phone Store is 0.99 USD so the app had to be made free for the promotion. So I filled in the form saying that I want my app to be free in all the countries during the promotion. When the time of the promotion came, the price was set to free in all the countries except Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia. First day, first problem.</p>

                       <p>My MVVM framework of choice, Caliburn.Micro, provides a simple Dependency Injection container, where you have to register all your ViewModels and Services. This is done in the Bootstraper&#8217;s Configure method and may look like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/0353b26073fc11d3635f.js?file=reg1.cs"></script>

<p>where you typically register your ViewModels as per request and services as singletons.</p>

<p>Of course this is done just once, but having to register a ViewModel each time you create a new one can be a nuisance, especially in a large project.</p>

                       <p>In my current project I needed to solve one quite interesting problem. Imagine you have a map with some pins representing points of interest. If the user taps on a pin, a label with the place title is shown like on this image (that is not from the real project, obviously).</p>

<p><img src="/images/image_thumb_4_4.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The client had an interesting requirement. When the user taps the pin and the label is shown, they wanted the label to be centered on the map (basically move the map so the label appears in the middle of the map).</p>

                       <p>Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again). Ignoring certificate errors would be a much more comfortable approach. Of course, only do it in development with dev servers, not in production.</p>

<p>In Windows Phone 8.1 there are strangely two HttpClient classes, one in System.Net.Http and another in Windows.Web.Http. Normally you would go with the one in System.Net.Http because you are probably using it thanks to the mentioned Portable HTTP Client Libraries on every other platform. You are out of luck in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, if you want to ignore certificate errors, you have to use the one from Windows.Web.Http, because only this one accepts an IHttpFilter as an argument.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my [Pock8][1] app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE). This makes the app even more easy to use and valuable.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp81.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>The problem is that [all the documentation I found][3] and also [the sample app][4] are for Windows Runtime. Pock8 is a Silverligt app and I have no intentions to rewrite it to Windows Runtime.</p>

<p>I had to make some digging and I finally found the solution in a build video called [Contracts and Pickers: Building Apps that Work Together on Windows][5].</p>

                       <p>Some time ago I needed a way to programatically search the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store to get some info about apps for a project. I decided to write an F# script for that task and later added support for Windows Phone Store.</p>

<p><strong>Types</strong></p>

<p>I wanted the script to be easily usable from outside of F# so first I created a type for the app.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=types.fs"></script>

<p>I also needed a helper function to download data from the web. I used a classic WebClient with user agent set to Chrome, because the Windows Phone Store API requires a user agent header</p>

                       <p>[FAKE][1] is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) so that you can start using it without learning F#. If you need more than the default functionality you can either write F# or simply reference .NET assemblies.</p>

<p>I have been using FAKE for quite some time now on some fairly complex projects for not only building but also running tests and creating and pushing Nuget packages and I really like. I decided to add FAKE build scripts to my Windows Phone apps to make the process of generating a XAP file for the Windows Phone Store easier.</p>

<p>The FAKE script I use can by used with any Windows Phone app, it will build all the projects and copy the XAP file to a release directory.</p>

                       <p>If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator).</p>

<p><img src="/images/line.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1.</p>

                       <p>Getting contacts info on Windows Phone means using a callback based API provided by the Windows Phone SDK</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/9572748.js?file=Contacts.Standard.cs"></script>

<p>I really dislike all the callback-based API so I was looking for a way to convert it to an async/await based API. And it is quite easy to do so</p>
