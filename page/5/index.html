                       <p>In my current project I needed to solve one quite interesting problem. Imagine you have a map with some pins representing points of interest. If the user taps on a pin, a label with the place title is shown like on this image (that is not from the real project, obviously).</p>

<img src="/images/image_thumb_4_4.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>The client had an interesting requirement. When the user taps the pin and the label is shown, they wanted the label to be centered on the map (basically move the map so the label appears in the middle of the map).</p>

                       <p>Connecting to servers with self-signed, expired or otherwise problematic certificates has always been a problem in Windows Phone. There is no way to ignore certificate errors in Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, not even using the new Portable HTTP Client Libraries. If you are dealing with a self-signed certificate on the server, you have to somehow get it (may not always be possible) and install it on the device or in the emulator (for emulator every time you close and start it again). Ignoring certificate errors would be a much more comfortable approach. Of course, only do it in development with dev servers, not in production.</p>

<p>In Windows Phone 8.1 there are strangely two HttpClient classes, one in System.Net.Http and another in Windows.Web.Http. Normally you would go with the one in System.Net.Http because you are probably using it thanks to the mentioned Portable HTTP Client Libraries on every other platform. You are out of luck in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, if you want to ignore certificate errors, you have to use the one from Windows.Web.Http, because only this one accepts an IHttpFilter as an argument.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone 8.1 introduced many interesting new thing, the one I personally like the best as a developer is the Share Contract. The Share Contract allows your apps to share data using an unified and easy way and also to receive data from other apps. This functionality is important for my [Pock8][1] app, which is a Pocket client. By making Pock8 app a Share Contract target, the app can receive links from other apps, more importantly from the built-in webrowser (IE). This makes the app even more easy to use and valuable.</p>

<img src="/images/wp81.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>The problem is that [all the documentation I found][3] and also [the sample app][4] are for Windows Runtime. Pock8 is a Silverligt app and I have no intentions to rewrite it to Windows Runtime.</p>

<p>I had to make some digging and I finally found the solution in a build video called [Contracts and Pickers: Building Apps that Work Together on Windows][5].</p>

                       <p>Some time ago I needed a way to programatically search the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store to get some info about apps for a project. I decided to write an F# script for that task and later added support for Windows Phone Store.</p>

<p><strong>Types</strong></p>

<p>I wanted the script to be easily usable from outside of F# so first I created a type for the app.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/igorkulman/10019990.js?file=types.fs"></script>

<p>I also needed a helper function to download data from the web. I used a classic WebClient with user agent set to Chrome, because the Windows Phone Store API requires a user agent header</p>

                       <p>[FAKE][1] is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) so that you can start using it without learning F#. If you need more than the default functionality you can either write F# or simply reference .NET assemblies.</p>

<p>I have been using FAKE for quite some time now on some fairly complex projects for not only building but also running tests and creating and pushing Nuget packages and I really like. I decided to add FAKE build scripts to my Windows Phone apps to make the process of generating a XAP file for the Windows Phone Store easier.</p>

<p>The FAKE script I use can by used with any Windows Phone app, it will build all the projects and copy the XAP file to a release directory.</p>

                       <p>If you create an Windows Phone 8 app and test it only on WVGA and 720p devices or emulators, you may be surprised how you app looks on a WXGA device (or emulator).</p>

<p>I have not been able the reason why this happens but the solution is quite simple. Set your page&#8217;s top border to -1.</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone Store does not offer developers any sandbox to test in-app purchases in their apps, like stores on other platforms do. If you want test in-app purchases in your Windows Phone apps, you need to use other options.</p>

<p>To make in-app purchases implementation easier, I created a simple Windows Phone Store service interface in my [Kulman.WP8][1] library (also [available on Nuget][2])</p>

                       <p>Recently I have released a new Windows Phone app called [Pock8][1]. Pock8 is a beautiful Pocket (formerly Read It Later) client for Windows Phone. The design of the app was created by Jan Marek who worked with my on the [Shopping List Simple][2] app.</p>

<img src="/images/pocket.png" alt="" class="pure-img" >

<p>Our goal was to create a Pocket client that would be really easy to use and that would have a nice and simple design. I think we have achieved our goal. The main features of the app are</p>

<ul>
<li>clean and simple design</li>
<li>optimized article view for comfortable reading</li>
<li>article cache for offline reading</li>
<li>dark theme for OLED screens or reading in the dark</li>
<li>support for receiving articles from other apps like WPCentral</li>
<li>listening to articles aloud</li>
<li>sharing articles</li>
</ul>

                       <p>If you develop mobile or any other kinds of apps, you need to have your source code versioned and stored in a safe place, cooperate with other people, track information about the usage of your apps and track all the errors that may occur. There are many free services that may help you with those tasks. In this article I will give you a list of the ones I use when developing [my apps][1].</p>

<p><strong>Bitbucket: source control and issue tracker</strong></p>

<p>I use Git as my source control system and all my private repos are stored at [Bitbucket]<a href="public at [GitHub][3]">2</a>. Bitbucket offers unlimited number of private repos and cooperation with up to 5 other people for free.</p>

<p>For each private repo you can create a private issue tracker also for free, so all your code and issues are at the same place. The main advantage is that source control and issue tracker are connected, so you can comment or close issues directly from Git commits.</p>
