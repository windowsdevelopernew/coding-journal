                       <p>I needed to create an utility that would read Excel 2010 files (.xlsx) and generate XML files from them according to some specific rules. The catch was that the utility needed to run on MacOS instead of Windows.</p>

<p>Reading and writing Excel files from .NET is [very easy using the Microsoft.Office.Interop assemblies][1] but they use Excel through COM and that makes them unusable outside of Windows. I found some 3rd party libraries for working with Excel and analzyed them with [The Mono Migration Analzyer]<a href="MoMA">2</a>. MoMA is a handy tool that analyzes .NET assemblies and tells you if they will run on Mono. Many of the Excel libraries I found were unusable for my use-case because they were using PInvoke calls. Only the [ExcelPackage library][3] runs on Mono.</p>

<p>I wanted to use the ExcelPackage from F# not C# so I wrote a [very simple F# wrapper][4], that you can freely use. For now it contains just a few methods</p>

                       <p>Uploading a file in ASP.NET MVC is very easy, but there is no easy way to detect the encoding of a uploaded text file. However you can use the fact if you try to read the file with a wrong encoding, you get an DecoderFallbackException. So how do you put everything together?</p>

<p>First, get a stream of the uploaded file.</p>

                       <p>While reading an article that had nothing in common with programming I came upon a sudden need to find a way to generate all the permutations of a list, or more exactly a string (it is just a list of characters). As lazy as I am I tried to google a few examples of C# code that does exactly that. I was horrified that programmers could come up with the complicated ways I found. Not to mention programmers writing a ton of unit test and classes before actualy writing the code that solves to problem.</p>

<p>The problem is naturally recursive. All the permutations of a list of n items consit of each of the n items combined with all the permutations of the list without the actual item. So if you have a list of let&#8217;s say items (a,b,c), all the permutations are (a+permutation((b,c)) + (b+permutations((a,c))) + (c+permutations((a,b)).</p>

<p>First I came up with F# code to solve it, after some yield googling:</p>

                       <p>Windows Phone allows yout to use custom TTF fonts in your apps. Using a custom font from XAML or C# is easy, but your run into troubles when you want to use if from a Background Agent (e.g: for updating a Live Tile).</p>

<p><strong>Adding font to solution</strong></p>

<p>The custom font must be a TTF, you can also use a ZIP file with multiple TTF files. You need to know the name of the font to identify it. Add the font file to your solution and set its build action to Content.</p>

<p><strong>Custom font and XAML</strong></p>

<p>Using a custom font in XAML is very straightforward. You just need to set the <em>FontFamily</em> property to the font file path followed by a hash (#) and the font name:</p>

You can configure Sublime Text 2 to higlight and compile F# files and even to use F# Interactive and make it a F# REPL. Using Sublime Text 2 as F# REPL is useful when you work on MacOS and Linux (F# 3.0 works great with [Mono][2]) and cannot use Visual Studio 2012. If you are new to Sublime Text 2, check out the [Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text: Free Course][3].</p>

<p><strong>Installing necessary packages</strong></p>

<p>In order to use F# Interactive in Sublime Text 2, you have to install a few packages first. All the packages can be installed using [Sublime Package Control][4]. You need to install the following packages:</p>

                       <p>I have been [playing with MonoTouch][1] only for a few days when I already started to miss all the .NET libraries I commonly use. The first one I needed to get working with MonoTouch was [JSON.NET][2].</p>

<p>MonoDevelop does not support Nuget so you have to get your libaries the old way. I downloaded JSON.NET package from [Nuget.org][3], but it does not contain a DLL built for Mono. Harldy any Nuget package does. You can reference a DLL built for .NET, MonoDevelop will recognize it and even offer you IntelliSense but your project will not get built.</p>

<p>The right way to get a .NET library working with MonoTouch is downloading its source code and building it yourself. You can use MonoDevelop to build the source codes. The only think you have to do (at least for JSON.NET) is to change the .NET profile to an equivalent Mono profile in the project settings.</p>

                       <p>Beeing [quite disappointed with the Windows Phone platform recently][1] I started to look for other ways to use my .NET skills and to develop for a mobile platform at the same time. I found [MonoTouch][2], a product from Xamarin that allows you to build iOS apps using C# with Mono.</p>

<p><strong>What is MonoTouch?</strong></p>

<p>MonoTouch is a product or a framework do develop iOS apps using [Mono]<a href="an open-source .NET implementation">3</a>. It allows you to use C# (hopefuly also F# although I have not been able to get it to work yet) and all the .NET features libraries you use and like and of course your existing codebase. No Objective-C knowledge is required, but you will have to learn about the iOS ecosystem an iOS SDK. The iOS SDK is also needed, so you cannot do the development in Windows, you have to use a Mac. There are ways to get MacOS X working on a PC as a native install or in VMWare / VirtualBox, if you just want to try it out, but it may not be legal.</p>

                       <p>Before I start with the actual arguments I feel a need to state my background first so you do not mistake me with just another hater rattling about things he does not know. I have been a long time .NET developer, I have worked with winforms, webforms, mvc, compact framework. I really like C# and love F#. In February I started to work as a full time Windows Phone developer. Although I have been programming exclusively for Windows 8 for the last few months I have a ton of experience with Windows Phone programming.</p>

<p><strong>Good old Windows Phone 7 times</strong></p>

<p>I really like Windows Phone 7 as a programmer. Although capabilities of this mobile OS are very limited compared to other platforms, the things you can do can be done easily and reliably. The OS is based on Silverlight, which is a mature platform. Everything works as you would expect.</p>

<p><strong>The abomination called Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>When I first got my hands on a Windows Phone 8 phone I was really disappointed. I wrote two concrete post about [troubles with Windows Phone Store region][1] and an [unaccountable approach to MP3 tags][2] but lets take it more generally. Windows Phone 8 feels like Windows Phone 7 written from scratch using another technology, visually looking nearly the same but full of bugs and unfinished things. I am really amazed at things that worked on Windows Phone 7 but work much worse on Windows Phone 8. I thought that only Czech and Slovak people suffered from the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome but clearly it might be a more widespread disease.</p>
